INITIAL ISSUE:
################################################################################
You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.
<IMPORTANT>
* If user provides a path, you should NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. Instead, you should explore the file system to find the file before working on it.
* When configuring git credentials, use "openhands" as the user.name and "openhands@all-hands.dev" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
* The assistant MUST NOT include comments in the code unless they are necessary to describe non-obvious behavior.
</IMPORTANT>
You have access to the following functions:

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #1: execute_bash ----
Description: Execute a bash command in the terminal.
* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, it should be run in the background and the output should be redirected to a file, e.g. command = `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`.
* Interactive: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. The assistant must then send a second call to terminal with an empty `command` (which will retrieve any additional logs), or it can send additional text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process, or it can send command like `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the process.

Parameters:
  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty string to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the currently running process.
---- END FUNCTION #1 ----

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: finish ----
Description: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.
No parameters are required for this function.
---- END FUNCTION #2 ----

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----
Description: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files
* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user
* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep
* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file
* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`
* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`

Notes for using the `str_replace` command:
* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!
* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique
* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`

Parameters:
  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.
Allowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]
  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/workspace/file.py` or `/workspace`.
  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.
  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.
  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.
  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.
  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.
---- END FUNCTION #3 ----


If you choose to call a function ONLY reply in the following format with NO suffix:

<function=example_function_name>
<parameter=example_parameter_1>value_1</parameter>
<parameter=example_parameter_2>
This is the value for the second parameter
that can span
multiple lines
</parameter>
</function>

<IMPORTANT>
Reminder:
- Function calls MUST follow the specified format, start with <function= and end with </function>
- Required parameters MUST be specified
- Only call one function at a time
- You may provide optional reasoning for your function call in natural language BEFORE the function call, but NOT after.
- If there is no function call available, answer the question like normal with your current knowledge and do not tell the user about function calls


Here's a running example of how to perform a task with the provided tools.

--------------------- NEW TASK DESCRIPTION ---------------------
<uploaded_files>
/workspace/django__django__4.2
</uploaded_files>
I've uploaded a python code repository in the directory django__django__4.2. Consider the following PR description:

<pr_description>
inspect.signature() returns incorrect signature on manager methods.
Description
	 
		(last modified by Shiva Kumar)
	 
inspect.signature returns incorrect signature information when used on queryset methods
import inspect
from django.db import models
class Person(models.Model):
	name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
print(inspect.signature(Person.objects.bulk_create))
# actual: (*args, **kwargs)
# expected: (objs, batch_size=None, ignore_conflicts=False)
ipython and jupyter seem to internally use inspect.signature to show documentation when using the <obj>? command and they too show incorrect signature information:
 
The issue is due to the code at ​https://github.com/django/django/blob/fe2e1478464846638082219c933a4302e5cf3037/django/db/models/manager.py#L84
Although we are ensuring the decorated method has the right name and docstring on lines 87 and 88, complete metadata is not copied.
The fix is to use functools.wraps instead of manually assigning name and docstring. wraps will take care of all the metadata and inspect.signature will return the expected output.
If the bug is acknowledged please assign the ticket to me, I would like to raise a PR for this.

</pr_description>

Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?
I've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!
Your task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /workspace directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.
Follow these steps to resolve the issue:
1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.
2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error
3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue
4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!
5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well
Your thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.

<extra_info>
The following information has been included based on a keyword match for "github". It may or may not be relevant to the user's request.

You have access to an environment variable, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, which allows you to interact with
the GitHub API.

You can use `curl` with the `GITHUB_TOKEN` to interact with GitHub's API.
ALWAYS use the GitHub API for operations instead of a web browser.

Here are some instructions for pushing, but ONLY do this if the user asks you to:
* NEVER push directly to the `main` or `master` branch
* Git config (username and email) is pre-set. Do not modify.
* You may already be on a branch starting with `openhands-workspace`. Create a new branch with a better name before pushing.
* Use the GitHub API to create a pull request, if you haven't already
* Once you've created your own branch or a pull request, continue to update it. Do NOT create a new one unless you are explicitly asked to. Update the PR title and description as necessary, but don't change the branch name.
* Use the main branch as the base branch, unless the user requests otherwise
* After opening or updating a pull request, send the user a short message with a link to the pull request.
* Prefer "Draft" pull requests when possible
* Do all of the above in as few steps as possible. E.g. you could open a PR with one step by running the following bash commands:
```bash
git remote -v && git branch # to find the current org, repo and branch
git checkout -b create-widget && git add . && git commit -m "Create widget" && git push -u origin create-widget
curl -X POST "https://api.github.com/repos/$ORG_NAME/$REPO_NAME/pulls" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
    -d '{"title":"Create widget","head":"create-widget","base":"openhands-workspace"}'
```
</extra_info>

PLEASE follow the format strictly! PLEASE EMIT ONE AND ONLY ONE FUNCTION CALL PER MESSAGE.

RESPONSE:
The `manager.py` file contains the `BaseManager` and `Manager` classes, which are used to define managers for Django models. The issue described in the PR is related to the `bulk_create` method, which is not being handled correctly by `inspect.signature`.

To fix this issue, we need to use `functools.wraps` instead of manually assigning the name and docstring to the decorated method. This will ensure that all metadata is copied correctly.

Let's edit the `bulk_create` method in the `BaseManager` class to use `functools.wraps`.

The `bulk_create` method is defined within the `_get_queryset_methods` class method. Let's edit this method to use `functools.wraps`.

RESPONSE:
The `create_method` function is defined within the `_get_queryset_methods` class method, and it is used to create new methods for the manager. Let's edit the `bulk_create` method to use `functools.wraps`.

RESPONSE:
It seems that the `old_str` parameter did not match exactly with the content in the file. Let's try to find the correct line where the `bulk_create` method is defined and then apply the replacement.
