Instead, you should explore the file system to find the file before working on it.\n* When configuring git credentials, use \"openhands\" as the user.name and \"openhands@all-hands.dev\" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* The assistant MUST NOT include comments in the code unless they are necessary to describe non-obvious behavior.\n</IMPORTANT>\nYou have access to the following functions:\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #1: execute_bash ----\nDescription: Execute a bash command in the terminal.\n* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, it should be run in the background and the output should be redirected to a file, e.g. command = `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`.\n* Interactive: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. The assistant must then send a second call to terminal with an empty `command` (which will retrieve any additional logs), or it can send additional text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process, or it can send command like `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the process.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty string to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the currently running process.\n---- END FUNCTION #1 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: finish ----\nDescription: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.\nNo parameters are required for this function.\n---- END FUNCTION #2 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----\nDescription: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files\n* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user\n* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n\nNotes for using the `str_replace` command:\n* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!\n* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique\n* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\nAllowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]\n  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/workspace/file.py` or `/workspace`.\n  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\n  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\n  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.\n  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.\n  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start.

This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /workspace directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4.

The user does not\n     8\tneed to do anything for dates to be formatted, but dates often have strict\n     9\tformatting needs, so this module provides many axis locators and formatters.\n    10\tA basic example using `numpy.datetime64` is::\n    11\t\n    12\t    import numpy as np\n    13\t\n    14\t    times = np.arange(np.datetime64('2001-01-02'),\n    15\t                      np.datetime64('2002-02-03'), np.timedelta64(75, 'm'))\n    16\t    y = np.random.randn(len(times))\n    17\t\n    18\t    fig, ax = plt.subplots()\n    19\t    ax.plot(times, y)\n    20\t\n    21\t.. seealso::\n    22\t\n    23\t    - :doc:`/gallery/text_labels_and_annotations/date`\n    24\t    - :doc:`/gallery/ticks/date_concise_formatter`\n    25\t    - :doc:`/gallery/ticks/date_demo_convert`\n    26\t\n    27\t.. _date-format:\n    28\t\n    29\tMatplotlib date format\n    30\t----------------------\n    31\t\n    32\tMatplotlib represents dates using floating point numbers specifying the number\n    33\tof days since a default epoch of 1970-01-01 UTC; for example,\n    34\t1970-01-01, 06:00 is the floating point number 0.25. The formatters and\n    35\tlocators require the use of `datetime.datetime` objects, so only dates between\n    36\tyear 0001 and 9999 can be represented.  Microsecond precision\n    37\tis achievable for (approximately) 70 years on either side of the epoch, and\n    38\t20 microseconds for the rest of the allowable range of dates (year 0001 to\n    39\t9999). The epoch can be changed at import time via `.dates.set_epoch` or\n    40\t:rc:`dates.epoch` to other dates if necessary; see\n    41\t:doc:`/gallery/ticks/date_precision_and_epochs` for a discussion.\n    42\t\n    43\t.. note::\n    44\t\n    45\t   Before Matplotlib 3.3, the epoch was 0000-12-31 which lost modern\n    46\t   microsecond precision and also made the default axis limit of 0 an invalid\n    47\t   datetime.  In 3.3 the epoch was changed as above.  To convert old\n    48\t   ordinal floats to the new epoch, users can do::\n    49\t\n    50\t     new_ordinal = old_ordinal + mdates.date2num(np.datetime64('0000-12-31'))\n    51\t\n    52\t\n    53\tThere are a number of helper functions to convert between :mod:`datetime`\n    54\tobjects and Matplotlib dates:\n    55\t\n    56\t.. currentmodule:: matplotlib.dates\n    57\t\n    58\t.. autosummary::\n    59\t   :nosignatures:\n    60\t\n    61\t   datestr2num\n    62\t   date2num\n    63\t   num2date\n    64\t   num2timedelta\n    65\t   drange\n    66\t   set_epoch\n    67\t   get_epoch\n    68\t\n    69\t.. note::\n    70\t\n    71\t   Like Python's `datetime.datetime`, Matplotlib uses the Gregorian calendar\n    72\t   for all conversions between dates and floating point numbers. This practice\n    73\t   is not universal, and calendar differences can cause confusing\n    74\t   differences between what Python and Matplotlib give as the number of days\n    75\t   since 0001-01-01 and what other software and databases yield.  For\n    76\t   example, the US Naval Observatory uses a calendar that switches\n    77\t   from Julian to Gregorian in October, 1582.  Hence, using their\n    78\t   calculator, the number of days between 0001-01-01 and 2006-04-01 is\n    79\t   732403, whereas using the Gregorian calendar via the datetime\n    80\t   module we find::\n    81\t\n    82\t     In [1]: date(2006, 4, 1).toordinal() - date(1, 1, 1).toordinal()\n    83\t     Out[1]: 732401\n    84\t\n    85\tAll the Matplotlib date converters, tickers and formatters are timezone aware.\n    86\tIf no explicit timezone is provided, :rc:`timezone` is assumed, provided as a\n    87\tstring.  If you want to use a different timezone, pass the *tz* keyword\n    88\targument of `num2date` to any date tickers or locators you create.  This can\n    89\tbe either a `datetime.tzinfo` instance or a string with the timezone name that\n    90\tcan be parsed by `~dateutil.tz.gettz`.\n    91\t\n    92\tA wide range of specific and general purpose date tick locators and\n    93\tformatters are provided in this module.  See\n    94\t:mod:`matplotlib.ticker` for general information on tick locators\n    95\tand formatters.  These are described below.\n    96\t\n    97\tThe dateutil_ module provides additional code to handle date ticking, making it\n    98\teasy to place ticks on any kinds of dates.  See examples below.\n    99\t\n   100\t.. _dateutil: https://dateutil.readthedocs.io\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<|begin_of_thought|>\n\nLooking through the 'dates.py' file, I can see that it contains various date-related functions and classes for Matplotlib. I need to find the ConciseDateFormatter class definition to understand how it works and identify what might be causing the year not to display when plotting less than 12 months of data.\n\nSince the initial search didn't find the class, perhaps it's defined in a different file or imported from another module.

The user does not\n     8\tneed to do anything for dates to be formatted, but dates often have strict\n     9\tformatting needs, so this module provides many axis locators and formatters.\n    10\tA basic example using `numpy.datetime64` is::\n    11\t\n    12\t    import numpy as np\n    13\t\n    14\t    times = np.arange(np.datetime64('2001-01-02'),\n    15\t                      np.datetime64('2002-02-03'), np.timedelta64(75, 'm'))\n    16\t    y = np.random.randn(len(times))\n    17\t\n    18\t    fig, ax = plt.subplots()\n    19\t    ax.plot(times, y)\n    20\t\n    21\t.. seealso::\n    22\t\n    23\t    - :doc:`/gallery/text_labels_and_annotations/date`\n    24\t    - :doc:`/gallery/ticks/date_concise_formatter`\n    25\t    - :doc:`/gallery/ticks/date_demo_convert`\n    26\t\n    27\t.. _date-format:\n    28\t\n    29\tMatplotlib date format\n    30\t----------------------\n    31\t\n    32\tMatplotlib represents dates using floating point numbers specifying the number\n    33\tof days since a default epoch of 1970-01-01 UTC; for example,\n    34\t1970-01-01, 06:00 is the floating point number 0.25. The formatters and\n    35\tlocators require the use of `datetime.datetime` objects, so only dates between\n    36\tyear 0001 and 9999 can be represented.  Microsecond precision\n    37\tis achievable for (approximately) 70 years on either side of the epoch, and\n    38\t20 microseconds for the rest of the allowable range of dates (year 0001 to\n    39\t9999). The epoch can be changed at import time via `.dates.set_epoch` or\n    40\t:rc:`dates.epoch` to other dates if necessary; see\n    41\t:doc:`/gallery/ticks/date_precision_and_epochs` for a discussion.\n    42\t\n    43\t.. note::\n    44\t\n    45\t   Before Matplotlib 3.3, the epoch was 0000-12-31 which lost modern\n    46\t   microsecond precision and also made the default axis limit of 0 an invalid\n    47\t   datetime.  In 3.3 the epoch was changed as above.  To convert old\n    48\t   ordinal floats to the new epoch, users can do::\n    49\t\n    50\t     new_ordinal = old_ordinal + mdates.date2num(np.datetime64('0000-12-31'))\n    51\t\n    52\t\n    53\tThere are a number of helper functions to convert between :mod:`datetime`\n    54\tobjects and Matplotlib dates:\n    55\t\n    56\t.. currentmodule:: matplotlib.dates\n    57\t\n    58\t.. autosummary::\n    59\t   :nosignatures:\n    60\t\n    61\t   datestr2num\n    62\t   date2num\n    63\t   num2date\n    64\t   num2timedelta\n    65\t   drange\n    66\t   set_epoch\n    67\t   get_epoch\n    68\t\n    69\t.. note::\n    70\t\n    71\t   Like Python's `datetime.datetime`, Matplotlib uses the Gregorian calendar\n    72\t   for all conversions between dates and floating point numbers. This practice\n    73\t   is not universal, and calendar differences can cause confusing\n    74\t   differences between what Python and Matplotlib give as the number of days\n    75\t   since 0001-01-01 and what other software and databases yield.  For\n    76\t   example, the US Naval Observatory uses a calendar that switches\n    77\t   from Julian to Gregorian in October, 1582.  Hence, using their\n    78\t   calculator, the number of days between 0001-01-01 and 2006-04-01 is\n    79\t   732403, whereas using the Gregorian calendar via the datetime\n    80\t   module we find::\n    81\t\n    82\t     In [1]: date(2006, 4, 1).toordinal() - date(1, 1, 1).toordinal()\n    83\t     Out[1]: 732401\n    84\t\n    85\tAll the Matplotlib date converters, tickers and formatters are timezone aware.\n    86\tIf no explicit timezone is provided, :rc:`timezone` is assumed, provided as a\n    87\tstring.  If you want to use a different timezone, pass the *tz* keyword\n    88\targument of `num2date` to any date tickers or locators you create.  This can\n    89\tbe either a `datetime.tzinfo` instance or a string with the timezone name that\n    90\tcan be parsed by `~dateutil.tz.gettz`.\n    91\t\n    92\tA wide range of specific and general purpose date tick locators and\n    93\tformatters are provided in this module.  See\n    94\t:mod:`matplotlib.ticker` for general information on tick locators\n    95\tand formatters.  These are described below.\n    96\t\n    97\tThe dateutil_ module provides additional code to handle date ticking, making it\n    98\teasy to place ticks on any kinds of dates.
