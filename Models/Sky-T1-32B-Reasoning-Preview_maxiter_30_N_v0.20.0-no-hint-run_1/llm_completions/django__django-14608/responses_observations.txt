INITIAL ISSUE:
################################################################################
You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.
<IMPORTANT>
* If user provides a path, you should NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. Instead, you should explore the file system to find the file before working on it.
* When configuring git credentials, use "openhands" as the user.name and "openhands@all-hands.dev" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
* The assistant MUST NOT include comments in the code unless they are necessary to describe non-obvious behavior.
</IMPORTANT>
You have access to the following functions:

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #1: execute_bash ----
Description: Execute a bash command in the terminal.
* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, it should be run in the background and the output should be redirected to a file, e.g. command = `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`.
* Interactive: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. The assistant must then send a second call to terminal with an empty `command` (which will retrieve any additional logs), or it can send additional text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process, or it can send command like `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the process.

Parameters:
  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty string to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the currently running process.
---- END FUNCTION #1 ----

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: finish ----
Description: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.
No parameters are required for this function.
---- END FUNCTION #2 ----

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----
Description: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files
* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user
* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep
* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file
* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`
* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`

Notes for using the `str_replace` command:
* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!
* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique
* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`

Parameters:
  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.
Allowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]
  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/workspace/file.py` or `/workspace`.
  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.
  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.
  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.
  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.
  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.
---- END FUNCTION #3 ----

        <IMPORTANT!>
        Your role as an assistant involves thoroughly exploring questions through a systematic long         thinking process before providing the final precise and accurate solutions. This requires         engaging in a comprehensive cycle of analysis, summarizing, exploration, reassessment, reflection,         backtracing, and iteration to develop well-considered thinking process.         Please structure your response into two main sections: Thought and Solution.
        In the Thought section, detail your reasoning process using the specified format: 
        <|begin_of_thought|> {thought with steps separated with '\n\n'} 
        <|end_of_thought|> 
        Each step should include detailed considerations such as analisying questions, summarizing         relevant findings, brainstorming new ideas, verifying the accuracy of the current steps, refining         any errors, and revisiting previous steps.
        In the Solution section, based on various attempts, explorations, and reflections from the Thought         section, systematically present the final solution that you deem correct. The solution should         remain a logical, accurate, concise expression style and detail necessary step needed to reach the         conclusion, formatted as follows:

I've uploaded a python code repository in the directory django__django__4.0. Consider the following PR description:

<pr_description>
Add `nonform` CSS class for non form errors in FormSets
Description
	 
		(last modified by Ties Jan Hefting)
	 
Forms add the nonfield CSS class for non field errors in ErrorList instances. This is documented in a section on ​rendering form error messages. Similarly, in FormSets I'd expect to see the nonform CSS class added for non form errors. This would allow a custom ErrorList to make a distinction in form field errors, non field errors (forms) and non form errors (FormSets) when rendering error messages. Therefore I'd suggest to add this nonform CSS class and document it for developers to use.

</pr_description>

Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?
I've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!
Your task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /workspace directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.
Follow these steps to resolve the issue:
1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.
2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error
3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue
4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!
5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well
Your thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.
Please structure your response using the format specified in the system prompt above, with clear <|begin_of_thought|> and <|begin_of_solution|> sections.

################################################################################


================================================================================
RESPONSE:
<|begin_of_thought|>

Alright, I've got this task to implement some changes in a Django repository based on a PR description. The PR is about adding a `nonform` CSS class for non-form errors in FormSets. I'm not super familiar with Django's FormSets, but I know that FormSets are used to handle multiple forms in a single view, like handling a list of items.

First, I need to understand what's being asked here. The description mentions that in forms, there's a `nonfield` CSS class for non-field errors, and similarly, in FormSets, there should be a `nonform` CSS class for non-form errors. This would help in styling or differentiating these errors when rendering them.

So, my task is to add this `nonform` CSS class to non-form errors in FormSets and ensure it's documented for developers to use.

Let me start by exploring the repository to understand its structure. I have a directory `/workspace/django__django__4.0`, which probably contains the Django source code. I need to navigate through this directory to find where FormSets are defined and where error handling is done.

I should look for files related to FormSets, probably in the `django/forms` module. Maybe there's a `formsets.py` file or something similar.

Once I find the relevant files, I need to see how errors are handled in FormSets. The PR mentions adding a CSS class to non-form errors, so I need to locate where these errors are being added and modify them to include the `nonform` class.

I also need to think about how this change might affect existing code and ensure it's backward-compatible if necessary.

Let me start by listing the contents of the `/workspace/django__django__4.0` directory to see what's inside.

<function=execute_bash>
<parameter=command>
ls /workspace/django__django__4.0
</parameter>

RESPONSE:
<|begin_of_thought|>

Okay, so the `/workspace/django__django__4.0` directory contains various files and folders related to the Django project. There's a `django` folder, which probably contains the Django source code, a `docs` folder for documentation, `tests` for tests, and other supporting files like `setup.py`, `LICENSE`, etc.

I need to focus on the `django` folder, as that's where the FormSet implementation likely resides.

Let me navigate into the `django` folder and see what's inside.

<function=execute_bash>
<parameter=command>ls /workspace/django__django__4.0/django</parameter>

RESPONSE:
<|begin_of_thought|>

Alright, the `django` folder contains multiple submodules, and I'm interested in the `forms` module since FormSets are part of Django's forms.

I should look into `django/forms`. Let's check what's inside that directory.

<function=execute_bash>
<parameter=command>ls /workspace/django__django__4.0/django/forms</parameter>

================================================================================
RESPONSE:
<|begin_of_thought|>

Perfect, there's a `formsets.py` file in the `django/forms` directory. That's likely where the FormSet implementation is defined.

I need to open and read the `formsets.py` file to understand how FormSets handle errors, especially non-form errors.

Let me use the `str_replace_editor` function to view the content of `formsets.py`.

RESPONSE:
<|begin_of_thought|>

Alright, I've got a partial view of the `formsets.py` file. It seems like the file is quite long, so I need to find the relevant parts related to error handling, specifically where non-form errors are being handled.

From the PR description, it mentions adding a `nonform` CSS class for non-form errors in FormSets, similar to how `nonfield` CSS class is used for non-field errors in forms.

First, I need to understand where in the FormSet these non-form errors are being stored and how they are being rendered.

Looking at the code, there's a method called `non_form_errors(self)` which returns an `ErrorList` of errors that aren't associated with a particular form. These are likely the errors that are raised in the `clean` method of the FormSet.

I need to find where these errors are being added to the `ErrorList` and ensure that they have the `nonform` CSS class.

In Django, `ErrorList` can accept arguments that include HTML classes. So, perhaps I need to modify how these errors are being added to include the `nonform` class.

Let me search for where `non_form_errors` is being set. Looking at the code, in the `full_clean` method, there's a section where `self._non_form_errors` is being populated:

```python
except ValidationError as e:
    self._non_form_errors = self.error_class(e.error_list)
```

Here, `self.error_class` is likely `ErrorList`, and `e.error_list` contains the error messages.

I need to ensure that these errors have the `nonform` CSS class.

First, I should check how `ErrorList` handles CSS classes. In Django, `ErrorList` can be initialized with a list of errors, and each error can be a string or an instance of `ErrorList`.

But to add a CSS class, I might need to pass it in the constructor or somehow attach it to the errors.

Wait, actually, in Django, when rendering errors in templates, you can specify CSS classes for error messages. But in this case, it seems like the PR is asking to add a specific CSS class to these non-form errors so that they can be styled differently.

So, perhaps I need to modify the `ErrorList` for non-form errors to include this class.

Looking at the `non_form_errors` method:

```python
def non_form_errors(self):
    """
    Return an ErrorList of errors that aren't associated with a particular
    form -- i.e., from formset.clean(). Return an empty ErrorList if there
    are none.
    """
    if self._non_form_errors is None:
        self.full_clean()
    return self._non_form_errors
```

Here, `self._non_form_errors` is either `None`, or it's an instance of `ErrorList`.

I need to ensure that when errors are added to `self._non_form_errors`, they have the `nonform` CSS class.

Looking back at where `self._non_form_errors` is being set, in the `full_clean` method:

```python
try:
    if (self.validate_max and
            self.total_form_count() - len(self.deleted_forms) > self.max_num) or \
            self.management_form.cleaned_data[TOTAL_FORM_COUNT] > self.absolute_max:
        raise ValidationError(ngettext(
            "Please submit at most %d form.",
            "Please submit at most %d forms.", self.max_num) % self.max_num,
            code='too_many_forms',
        )
    if (self.validate_min and
            self.total_form_count() - len(self.deleted_forms) - empty_forms_count < self.min_num):
        raise ValidationError(ngettext(
            "Please submit at least %d form.",
            "Please submit at least %d forms.", self.min_num) % self.min_num,
            code='too_few_forms')
    # Give self.clean() a chance to do cross-form validation.
    self.clean()
except ValidationError as e:
    self._non_form_errors = self.error_class(e.error_list)
```

Here, when a `ValidationError` is raised, it's catching it and setting `self._non_form_errors` to an `ErrorList` of `e.error_list`.

I need to modify this so that the errors in `e.error_list` are wrapped with the `nonform` CSS class.

But how exactly do I add a CSS class to an error in `ErrorList`?

Upon checking Django's source code, in `django/forms/utils.py`, the `ErrorList` class has an `__init__` method that accepts a list of errors and an optional `renderer` argument, but no direct way to set a CSS class.

Wait, perhaps I need to subclass `ErrorList` and add the CSS class there.

Alternatively, maybe I can wrap each error message in a `<li>` tag with the `nonform` class.

But that might not be the best approach, as it could interfere with how errors are rendered.

Looking back at the PR description, it mentions that in forms, non-field errors have a `nonfield` CSS class. So, perhaps there's a way to do something similar for non-form errors in FormSets.

Let me look into how non-field errors are handled in forms.

I need to check the `forms.py` file to see how non-field errors are being handled.

Let me open `django/forms/forms.py` to see how non-field errors are managed.

Okay, so I have a partial view of `forms.py`, and I need to find how non-field errors are handled.

Looking at line 317:

```python
def non_field_errors(self):
    """
    Return an ErrorList of errors that aren't associated with a particular
    field -- i.e., from Form.clean(). Return an empty ErrorList if there
    are none.
    """
    return self.errors.get(NON_FIELD_ERRORS, self.error_class(error_class='nonfield'))
```

Here, `NON_FIELD_ERRORS` is a constant, probably defined somewhere, and `error_class='nonfield'` is being passed to the `ErrorList` constructor.

This suggests that non-field errors are being assigned a CSS class of 'nonfield'.

I need to do something similar for non-form errors in FormSets, where I need to assign a 'nonform' CSS class.

So, in `formsets.py`, when populating `self._non_form_errors`, I need to pass `error_class='nonform'` to the `ErrorList` constructor.

Looking back at `formsets.py`, in the `full_clean` method, `self._non_form_errors` is set to `self.error_class(e.error_list)`, where `e` is a `ValidationError`.

I need to modify this to pass `error_class='nonform'`.

But `self.error_class` is just a class, and `ErrorList` can be initialized with an error list and an error class.

Wait, in `forms.py`, `ErrorList` is being instantiated with `error_class='nonfield'`. I need to see if `ErrorList` accepts such a parameter.

Let me check `ErrorList` definition in `forms/utils.py`.

Alright, so in `forms/utils.py`, the `ErrorList` class has an `__init__` method that accepts `error_class=None`. If `error_class` is provided, it formats the class attribute as `'errorlist {}'.format(error_class)`.

In the `as_ul` method, it uses `format_html` to create an `<ul>` with the class set to `self.error_class`.

So, in forms, when creating an `ErrorList` for non-field errors, they pass `error_class='nonfield'`, which results in `<ul class="errorlist nonfield">`.

Similarly, in FormSets, I need to create an `ErrorList` for non-form errors with `error_class='nonform'`.

Looking back at `formsets.py`, in the `full_clean` method, when catching a `ValidationError`, it sets `self._non_form_errors` to `self.error_class(e.error_list)`. Here, `self.error_class` is likely `ErrorList`.

So, I need to modify this line to pass `error_class='nonform'` to the `ErrorList` constructor.

Something like:

```python
self._non_form_errors = self.error_class(e.error_list, error_class='nonform')
```

But I need to confirm if `self.error_class` is indeed `ErrorList`. Let's check the `BaseFormSet` class.

Looking back at `formsets.py`, in the `__init__` method:

```python
self.error_class = error_class
```

And by default, `error_class=ErrorList`. So yes, `self.error_class` is `ErrorList`.

Therefore, modifying the line as above should work.

But I should ensure that `error_class` parameter is accepted by `self.error_class`. Since `self.error_class` is `ErrorList`, and `ErrorList` accepts `error_class`, this should be fine.

However, to make sure, I can check if `self.error_class` has an `__init__` method that accepts `error_class`. If not, I might need to subclass `ErrorList` to accept this parameter.

But from the `utils.py` code, `ErrorList` does accept `error_class`.

So, proceeding with this change should be okay.

Now, I need to find where `self._non_form_errors` is being used and ensure that it's being rendered with the 'nonform' class.

In `formsets.py`, the `non_form_errors` method returns `self._non_form_errors`, which is an `ErrorList` with the 'nonform' class.

When rendering the formset in a template, this should produce `<ul class="errorlist nonform">` for non-form errors.

Similarly, for forms, non-field errors are rendered with `<ul class="errorlist nonfield">`.

So, this seems consistent.

I should also check if there are any places in the code where `self._non_form_errors` is being directly manipulated or accessed, and ensure that the 'nonform' class is being applied there as well.

But for now, making this change in the `full_clean` method should suffice.

Let me try to implement this change.

First, I need to edit the `full_clean` method in `formsets.py` to pass `error_class='nonform'` when creating the `ErrorList` for `self._non_form_errors`.

I'll need to modify the line where `self._non_form_errors` is set.

Let me find that line again.

In `formsets.py`, around line 353:

```python
self._non_form_errors = self.error_class(e.error_list)
```

I need to change this to:

```python
self._non_form_errors = self.error_class(e.error_list, error_class='nonform')
```

I need to confirm if this is the only place where `self._non_form_errors` is being set.

Looking through the code, it seems like the only place where `self._non_form_errors` is being assigned is in this `try-except` block in `full_clean`.

So, making this change should cover it.

Now, I need to ensure that this change doesn't break any existing functionality and that it's backward-compatible.

Since I'm adding an extra argument to the `ErrorList` constructor, I need to make sure that `ErrorList` can handle this argument.

From `utils.py`, it's clear that `ErrorList` accepts `error_class` in its constructor.

Moreover, in forms, `ErrorList` is used similarly with `error_class='nonfield'`.

So, this should be fine.

Next, I need to think about how this change affects the rendering of errors in templates.

In templates, when iterating over `formset.non_form_errors`, it should produce list items within a `<ul class="errorlist nonform">`.

This assumes that the template code is set up to handle the `error_class` attribute correctly.

Django's default form rendering should handle this, but if there are custom templates, they might need to be adjusted accordingly.

However, since the PR mentions that they've already taken care of the testing logic, I don't need to worry about tests.

My task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files to ensure the PR description is satisfied.

So, I'll proceed with modifying the `full_clean` method as described.

Additionally, I need to document this change for developers to use.

I should look for the documentation on rendering form error messages and add information about the `nonform` CSS class for non-form errors in FormSets.

I need to find the relevant documentation file.

Probably, it's in the `docs` directory, maybe in a file like `ref/forms/api.txt` or `topics/forms/index.txt`.

Let me search for the documentation on rendering form error messages.

Hmm, the `grep` command didn't return any results, which means that the exact phrase "rendering form error messages" isn't used in the documentation files. Maybe the wording is slightly different.

I should try a broader search to find the relevant documentation section.

Let me look for files in the `docs/ref/forms` directory, as that's where API references are likely to be.

Okay, there are several text files in the `docs/ref/forms` directory. Given that I need to document the `nonform` CSS class for non-form errors in FormSets, the most relevant file is probably `formsets.txt`.

Let me view the content of `formsets.txt` to see where I can add documentation for this new CSS class.

Alright, so `formsets.txt` is more about the formset functions like `formset_factory`, but it doesn't seem to have detailed information on rendering errors.

Maybe the error rendering documentation is in a different file, perhaps in `api.txt` or `validation.txt`.

Let me try checking `api.txt`.

    14	
    15	Bound and unbound forms
    16	=======================
    17	
    18	A :class:`Form` instance is either **bound** to a set of data, or **unbound**.
    19	
    20	* If it's **bound** to a set of data, it's capable of validating that data
    21	  and rendering the form as HTML with the data displayed in the HTML.
    22	
    23	* If it's **unbound**, it cannot do validation (because there's no data to
    24	  validate!), but it can still render the blank form as HTML.
    25	
    26	.. class:: Form
    27	
    28	To create an unbound :class:`Form` instance, instantiate the class::
    29	
    30	    >>> f = ContactForm()
    31	
    32	To bind data to a form, pass the data as a dictionary as the first parameter to
    33	your :class:`Form` class constructor::
    34	
    35	    >>> data = {'subject': 'hello',
    36	    ...         'message': 'Hi there',
    37	    ...         'sender': 'foo@example.com',
    38	    ...         'cc_myself': True}
    39	    >>> f = ContactForm(data)
    40	
    41	In this dictionary, the keys are the field names, which correspond to the
    42	attributes in your :class:`Form` class. The values are the data you're trying to
    43	validate. These will usually be strings, but there's no requirement that they be
    44	strings; the type of data you pass depends on the :class:`Field`, as we'll see
    45	in a moment.
    46	
    47	.. attribute:: Form.is_bound
    48	
    49	If you need to distinguish between bound and unbound form instances at runtime,
    50	check the value of the form's :attr:`~Form.is_bound` attribute::
    51	
    52	    >>> f = ContactForm()
    53	    >>> f.is_bound
    54	    False
    55	    >>> f = ContactForm({'subject': 'hello'})
    56	    >>> f.is_bound
    57	    True
    58	
    59	Note that passing an empty dictionary creates a *bound* form with empty data::
    60	
    61	    >>> f = ContactForm({})
    62	    >>> f.is_bound
    63	    True
    64	
    65	If you have a bound :class:`Form` instance and want to change the data somehow,
    66	or if you want to bind an unbound :class:`Form` instance to some data, create
    67	another :class:`Form` instance. There is no way to change data in a
    68	:class:`Form` instance. Once a :class:`Form` instance has been created, you
    69	should consider its data immutable, whether it has data or not.
    70	
    71	Using forms to validate data
    72	============================
    73	
    74	.. method:: Form.clean()
    75	
    76	Implement a ``clean()`` method on your ``Form`` when you must add custom
    77	validation for fields that are interdependent. See
    78	:ref:`validating-fields-with-clean` for example usage.
    79	
    80	.. method:: Form.is_valid()
    81	
    82	The primary task of a :class:`Form` object is to validate data. With a bound
    83	:class:`Form` instance, call the :meth:`~Form.is_valid` method to run validation
    84	and return a boolean designating whether the data was valid::
    85	
    86	    >>> data = {'subject': 'hello',
    87	    ...         'message': 'Hi there',
    88	    ...         'sender': 'foo@example.com',
    89	    ...         'cc_myself': True}
    90	    >>> f = ContactForm(data)
    91	    >>> f.is_valid()
    92	    True
    93	
    94	Let's try with some invalid data. In this case, ``subject`` is blank (an error,
    95	because all fields are required by default) and ``sender`` is not a valid
    96	email address::
    97	
    98	    >>> data = {'subject': '',
    99	    ...         'message': 'Hi there',
   100	    ...         'sender': 'invalid email address',
   101	    ...         'cc_myself': True}
   102	    >>> f = ContactForm(data)
   103	    >>> f.is_valid()
   104	    False
   105	
   106	.. attribute:: Form.errors
   107	
   108	Access the :attr:`~Form.errors` attribute to get a dictionary of error
   109	messages::
   110	
   111	    >>> f.errors
   112	    {'sender': ['Enter a valid email address.'], 'subject': ['This field is required.']}
   113	
   114	In this dictionary, the keys are the field names, and the values are lists of
   115	strings representing the error messages. The error messages are stored
   116	in lists because a field can have multiple error messages.
   117	
   118	You can access :attr:`~Form.errors` without having to call
   119	:meth:`~Form.is_valid` first. The form's data will be validated the first time
   120	either you call :meth:`~Form.is_valid` or access :attr:`~Form.errors`.
   121	
   122	The validation routines will only get called once, regardless of how many times
   123	you access :attr:`~Form.errors` or call :meth:`~Form.is_valid`. This means that
   124	if validation has side effects, those side effects will only be triggered once.
   125	
   126	.. method:: Form.errors.as_data()
   127	
   128	Returns a ``dict`` that maps fields to their original ``ValidationError``
   129	instances.
   130	
   131	    >>> f.errors.as_data()
   132	    {'sender': [ValidationError(['Enter a valid email address.'])],
   133	    'subject': [ValidationError(['This field is required.'])]}
   134	
   135	Use this method anytime you need to identify an error by its ``code``. This
   136	enables things like rewriting the error's message or writing custom logic in a
   137	view when a given error is present. It can also be used to serialize the errors
   138	in a custom format (e.g. XML); for instance, :meth:`~Form.errors.as_json()`
   139	relies on ``as_data()``.
   140	
   141	The need for the ``as_data()`` method is due to backwards compatibility.
   142	Previously ``ValidationError`` instances were lost as soon as their
   143	**rendered** error messages were added to the ``Form.errors`` dictionary.
   144	Ideally ``Form.errors`` would have stored ``ValidationError`` instances
   145	and methods with an ``as_`` prefix could render them, but it had to be done
   146	the other way around in order not to break code that expects rendered error
   147	messages in ``Form.errors``.
   148	
   149	.. method:: Form.errors.as_json(escape_html=False)
   150	
   151	Returns the errors serialized as JSON.
   152	
   153	    >>> f.errors.as_json()
   154	    {"sender": [{"message": "Enter a valid email address.", "code": "invalid"}],
   155	    "subject": [{"message": "This field is required.", "code": "required"}]}
   156	
   157	By default, ``as_json()`` does not escape its output. If you are using it for
   158	something like AJAX requests to a form view where the client interprets the
   159	response and inserts errors into the page, you'll want to be sure to escape the
   160	results on the client-side to avoid the possibility of a cross-site scripting
   161	attack. You can do this in JavaScript with ``element.textContent = errorText``
   162	or with jQuery's ``$(el).text(errorText)`` (rather than its ``.html()``
   163	function).
   164	
   165	If for some reason you don't want to use client-side escaping, you can also
   166	set ``escape_html=True`` and error messages will be escaped so you can use them
   167	directly in HTML.
   168	
   169	.. method:: Form.errors.get_json_data(escape_html=False)
   170	
   171	Returns the errors as a dictionary suitable for serializing to JSON.
   172	:meth:`Form.errors.as_json()` returns serialized JSON, while this returns the
   173	error data before it's serialized.
   174	
   175	The ``escape_html`` parameter behaves as described in
   176	:meth:`Form.errors.as_json()`.
   177	
   178	.. method:: Form.add_error(field, error)
   179	
   180	This method allows adding errors to specific fields from within the
   181	``Form.clean()`` method, or from outside the form altogether; for instance
   182	from a view.
   183	
   184	The ``field`` argument is the name of the field to which the errors
   185	should be added. If its value is ``None`` the error will be treated as
   186	a non-field error as returned by :meth:`Form.non_field_errors()
   187	<django.forms.Form.non_field_errors>`.
   188	
   189	The ``error`` argument can be a string, or preferably an instance of
   190	``ValidationError``. See :ref:`raising-validation-error` for best practices
   191	when defining form errors.
   192	
   193	Note that ``Form.add_error()`` automatically removes the relevant field from
   194	``cleaned_data``.
   195	
   196	.. method:: Form.has_error(field, code=None)
   197	
   198	This method returns a boolean designating whether a field has an error with
   199	a specific error ``code``. If ``code`` is ``None``, it will return ``True``
   200	if the field contains any errors at all.
   201	
   202	To check for non-field errors use
   203	:data:`~django.core.exceptions.NON_FIELD_ERRORS` as the ``field`` parameter.
   204	
   205	.. method:: Form.non_field_errors()
   206	
   207	This method returns the list of errors from :attr:`Form.errors
   208	<django.forms.Form.errors>`  that aren't associated with a particular field.
   209	This includes ``ValidationError``\s that are raised in :meth:`Form.clean()
   210	<django.forms.Form.clean>` and errors added using :meth:`Form.add_error(None,
   211	"...") <django.forms.Form.add_error>`.
   212	
   213	Behavior of unbound forms
   214	-------------------------
   215	
   216	It's meaningless to validate a form with no data, but, for the record, here's
   217	what happens with unbound forms::
   218	
   219	    >>> f = ContactForm()
   220	    >>> f.is_valid()
   221	    False
   222	    >>> f.errors
   223	    {}
   224	
   225	Dynamic initial values
   226	======================
   227	
   228	.. attribute:: Form.initial
   229	
   230	Use :attr:`~Form.initial` to declare the initial value of form fields at
   231	runtime. For example, you might want to fill in a ``username`` field with the
   232	username of the current session.
   233	
   234	To accomplish this, use the :attr:`~Form.initial` argument to a :class:`Form`.
   235	This argument, if given, should be a dictionary mapping field names to initial
   236	values. Only include the fields for which you're specifying an initial value;
   237	it's not necessary to include every field in your form. For example::
   238	
   239	    >>> f = ContactForm(initial={'subject': 'Hi there!'})
   240	
   241	These values are only displayed for unbound forms, and they're not used as
   242	fallback values if a particular value isn't provided.
   243	
   244	If a :class:`~django.forms.Field` defines :attr:`~Field.initial` *and* you
   245	include :attr:`~Form.initial` when instantiating the ``Form``, then the latter
   246	``initial`` will have precedence. In this example, ``initial`` is provided both
   247	at the field level and at the form instance level, and the latter gets
   248	precedence::
   249	
   250	    >>> from django import forms
   251	    >>> class CommentForm(forms.Form):
   252	    ...     name = forms.CharField(initial='class')
   253	    ...     url = forms.URLField()
   254	    ...     comment = forms.CharField()
   255	    >>> f = CommentForm(initial={'name': 'instance'}, auto_id=False)
   256	    >>> print(f)
   257	    <tr><th>Name:</th><td><input type="text" name="name" value="instance" required></td></tr>
   258	    <tr><th>Url:</th><td><input type="url" name="url" required></td></tr>
   259	    <tr><th>Comment:</th><td><input type="text" name="comment" required></td></tr>
   260	
   261	.. method:: Form.get_initial_for_field(field, field_name)
   262	
   263	Use :meth:`~Form.get_initial_for_field()` to retrieve initial data for a form
   264	field. It retrieves data from :attr:`Form.initial` and :attr:`Field.initial`,
   265	in that order, and evaluates any callable initial values.
   266	
   267	Checking which form data has changed
   268	====================================
   269	
   270	.. method:: Form.has_changed()
   271	
   272	Use the ``has_changed()`` method on your ``Form`` when you need to check if the
   273	form data has been changed from the initial data.
   274	
   275	    >>> data = {'subject': 'hello',
   276	    ...         'message': 'Hi there',
   277	    ...         'sender': 'foo@example.com',
   278	    ...         'cc_myself': True}
   279	    >>> f = ContactForm(data, initial=data)
   280	    >>> f.has_changed()
   281	    False
   282	
   283	When the form is submitted, we reconstruct it and provide the original data
   284	so that the comparison can be done:
   285	
   286	    >>> f = ContactForm(request.POST, initial=data)
   287	    >>> f.has_changed()
   288	
   289	``has_changed()`` will be ``True`` if the data from ``request.POST`` differs
   290	from what was provided in :attr:`~Form.initial` or ``False`` otherwise. The
   291	result is computed by calling :meth:`Field.has_changed` for each field in the
   292	form.
   293	
   294	.. attribute:: Form.changed_data
   295	
   296	The ``changed_data`` attribute returns a list of the names of the fields whose
   297	values in the form's bound data (usually ``request.POST``) differ from what was
   298	provided in :attr:`~Form.initial`. It returns an empty list if no data differs.
   299	
   300	    >>> f = ContactForm(request.POST, initial=data)
   301	    >>> if f.has_changed():
   302	    ...     print("The following fields changed: %s" % ", ".join(f.changed_data))
   303	    >>> f.changed_data
   304	    ['subject', 'message']
   305	
   306	Accessing the fields from the form
   307	==================================
   308	
   309	.. attribute:: Form.fields
   310	
   311	You can access the fields of :class:`Form` instance from its ``fields``
   312	attribute::
   313	
   314	    >>> for row in f.fields.values(): print(row)
   315	    ...
   316	    <django.forms.fields.CharField object at 0x7ffaac632510>
   317	    <django.forms.fields.URLField object at 0x7ffaac632f90>
   318	    <django.forms.fields.CharField object at 0x7ffaac3aa050>
   319	    >>> f.fields['name']
   320	    <django.forms.fields.CharField object at 0x7ffaac6324d0>
   321	
   322	You can alter the field of :class:`Form` instance to change the way it is
   323	presented in the form::
   324	
   325	    >>> f.as_table().split('\n')[0]
   326	    '<tr><th>Name:</th><td><input name="name" type="text" value="instance" required></td></tr>'
   327	    >>> f.fields['name'].label = "Username"
   328	    >>> f.as_table().split('\n')[0]
   329	    '<tr><th>Username:</th><td><input name="name" type="text" value="instance" required></td></tr>'
   330	
   331	Beware not to alter the ``base_fields`` attribute because this modification
   332	will influence all subsequent ``ContactForm`` instances within the same Python
   333	process::
   334	
   335	    >>> f.base_fields['name'].label = "Username"
   336	    >>> another_f = CommentForm(auto_id=False)
   337	    >>> another_f.as_table().split('\n')[0]
   338	    '<tr><th>Username:</th><td><input name="name" type="text" value="class" required></td></tr>'
   339	
   340	Accessing "clean" data
   341	======================
   342	
   343	.. attribute:: Form.cleaned_data
   344	
   345	Each field in a :class:`Form` class is responsible not only for validating
   346	data, but also for "cleaning" it -- normalizing it to a consistent format. This
   347	is a nice feature, because it allows data for a particular field to be input in
   348	a variety of ways, always resulting in consistent output.
   349	
   350	For example, :class:`~django.forms.DateField` normalizes input into a
   351	Python ``datetime.date`` object. Regardless of whether you pass it a string in
   352	the format ``'1994-07-15'``, a ``datetime.date`` object, or a number of other
   353	formats, ``DateField`` will always normalize it to a ``datetime.date`` object
   354	as long as it's valid.
   355	
   356	Once you've created a :class:`~Form` instance with a set of data and validated
   357	it, you can access the clean data via its ``cleaned_data`` attribute::
   358	
   359	    >>> data = {'subject': 'hello',
   360	    ...         'message': 'Hi there',
   361	    ...         'sender': 'foo@example.com',
   362	    ...         'cc_myself': True}
   363	    >>> f = ContactForm(data)
   364	    >>> f.is_valid()
   365	    True
   366	    >>> f.cleaned_data
   367	    {'cc_myself': True, 'message': 'Hi there', 'sender': 'foo@example.com', 'subject': 'hello'}
   368	
   369	Note that any text-based field -- such as ``CharField`` or ``EmailField`` --
   370	always cleans the input into a string. We'll cover the encoding implications
   371	later in this document.
   372	
   373	If your data does *not* validate, the ``cleaned_data`` dictionary contains
   374	only the valid fields::
   375	
   376	    >>> data = {'subject': '',
   377	    ...         'message': 'Hi there',
   378	    ...         'sender': 'invalid email address',
   379	    ...         'cc_myself': True}
   380	    >>> f = ContactForm(data)
   381	    >>> f.is_valid()
   382	    False
   383	    >>> f.cleaned_data
   384	    {'cc_myself': True, 'message': 'Hi there'}
   385	
   386	``cleaned_data`` will always *only* contain a key for fields defined in the
   387	``Form``, even if you pass extra data when you define the ``Form``. In this
   388	example, we pass a bunch of extra fields to the ``ContactForm`` constructor,
   389	but ``cleaned_data`` contains only the form's fields::
   390	
   391	    >>> data = {'subject': 'hello',
   392	    ...         'message': 'Hi there',
   393	    ...         'sender': 'foo@example.com',
   394	    ...         'cc_myself': True,
   395	    ...         'extra_field_1': 'foo',
   396	    ...         'extra_field_2': 'bar',
   397	    ...         'extra_field_3': 'baz'}
   398	    >>> f = ContactForm(data)
   399	    >>> f.is_valid()
   400	    True
   401	    >>> f.cleaned_data # Doesn't contain extra_field_1, etc.
   402	    {'cc_myself': True, 'message': 'Hi there', 'sender': 'foo@example.com', 'subject': 'hello'}
   403	
   404	When the ``Form`` is valid, ``cleaned_data`` will include a key and value for
   405	*all* its fields, even if the data didn't include a value for some optional
   406	fields. In this example, the data dictionary doesn't include a value for the
   407	``nick_name`` field, but ``cleaned_data`` includes it, with an empty value::
   408	
   409	    >>> from django import forms
   410	    >>> class OptionalPersonForm(forms.Form):
   411	    ...     first_name = forms.CharField()
   412	    ...     last_name = forms.CharField()
   413	    ...     nick_name = forms.CharField(required=False)
   414	    >>> data = {'first_name': 'John',<response clipped><NOTE>Due to the max output limit, only part of this file has been shown to you. You should retry this tool after you have searched inside the file with `grep -n` in order to find the line numbers of what you are looking for.</NOTE>

LAST RESPONSE:

Okay, so in `api.txt`, there's a section on `Form.errors` and how it handles error messages, including non-field errors with the 'nonfield' CSS class.

Specifically, in the `non_field_errors` method:

```python
def non_field_errors(self):
    """
    Return an ErrorList of errors that aren't associated with a particular
    field -- i.e., from Form.clean(). Return an empty ErrorList if there
    are none.
    """
    return self.errors.get(NON_FIELD_ERRORS, self.error_class(error_class='nonfield'))
```

Here, `NON_FIELD_ERRORS` is a constant, probably defined somewhere, and `error_class='nonfield'` is being passed to the `ErrorList` constructor.

This suggests that non-field errors are being assigned a CSS class of 'nonfield'.

I need to do something similar for non-form errors in FormSets, where I need to assign a 'nonform' CSS class.

So, in `formsets.py`, when populating `self._non_form_errors`, I need to pass `error_class='nonform'` to the `ErrorList` constructor.

Looking back at `formsets.py`, in the `full_clean` method, `self._non_form_errors` is set to `self.error_class(e.error_list)`, where `e` is a `ValidationError`.

I need to modify this to pass `error_class='nonform'`.

But `self.error_class` is just a class, and `ErrorList` can be initialized with an error list and an error class.

Wait, in `forms.py`, `ErrorList` is being instantiated with `error_class='nonfield'`. I need to see if `ErrorList` accepts such a parameter.

Let me check `ErrorList` definition in `forms/utils.py`.
