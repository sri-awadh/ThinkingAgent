################################################################################
INITIAL ISSUE:
################################################################################
You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.
<IMPORTANT>
* If user provides a path, you should NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. Instead, you should explore the file system to find the file before working on it.
* When configuring git credentials, use "openhands" as the user.name and "openhands@all-hands.dev" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
* The assistant MUST NOT include comments in the code unless they are necessary to describe non-obvious behavior.
</IMPORTANT>
You have access to the following functions:

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #1: execute_bash ----
Description: Execute a bash command in the terminal.
* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, it should be run in the background and the output should be redirected to a file, e.g. command = `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`.
* Interactive: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. The assistant must then send a second call to terminal with an empty `command` (which will retrieve any additional logs), or it can send additional text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process, or it can send command like `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the process.

Parameters:
  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty string to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the currently running process.
---- END FUNCTION #1 ----

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: finish ----
Description: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.
No parameters are required for this function.
---- END FUNCTION #2 ----

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----
Description: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files
* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user
* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep
* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file
* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`
* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`

Notes for using the `str_replace` command:
* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!
* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique
* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`

Parameters:
  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.
Allowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]
  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/workspace/file.py` or `/workspace`.
  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.
  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.
  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.
  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.
  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.
---- END FUNCTION #3 ----

--------------------- NEW TASK DESCRIPTION ---------------------
<uploaded_files>
/workspace/django__django__3.2
</uploaded_files>
I've uploaded a python code repository in the directory django__django__3.2. Consider the following PR description:

<pr_description>
Drop support for SQLite < 3.9.0
Description
	 
		(last modified by Tim Graham)
	 
Indexes on expressions (see #26167) and the SQLITE_ENABLE_JSON1 compile-time option are supported on ​SQLite 3.9.0+.
Ubuntu Xenial ships with SQLite 3.11.0 (which will still by supported by Django) and will EOL in April 2021. Debian Jessie ships with 3.8.7 and was EOL June 30, 2020.
SQLite 3.9.0 was released in October 2015. SQLite version support seems like a similar situation as GEOS libraries which we generally support about 5 years after released.

</pr_description>

Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?
I've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!
Your task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /workspace directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.
Follow these steps to resolve the issue:
1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.
2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error
3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue
4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!
5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well
Your thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.

================================================================================
RESPONSE:
Alright, I've got this task to update a Django repository to drop support for SQLite versions earlier than 3.9.0. The PR description mentions that indexes on expressions and the SQLITE_ENABLE_JSON1 option are supported on SQLite 3.9.0 and later. Also, it references that Ubuntu Xenial ships with SQLite 3.11.0, which is still supported, and Debian Jessie ships with 3.8.7, which is EOL.

First, I need to understand what this means for the Django codebase. Since we're dropping support for SQLite < 3.9.0, any features or optimizations that rely on SQLite 3.9.0+ should be implemented, and any workarounds or compatibility code for older SQLite versions can be removed.

Step 1: Explore the repository structure.

I need to navigate to the `/workspace/django__django__3.2` directory and see how the Django source code is organized. Typically, Django has a `django` package, along with test files and other supporting files.

Step 2: Identify where SQLite version checking occurs.

Django likely has version checks for different databases, including SQLite. I need to find where SQLite versions are checked and see if there's a place to set the minimum required version.

Step 3: Update the minimum required SQLite version.

I need to set the minimum required SQLite version to 3.9.0. This might involve updating a configuration file or a constant in the code.

Step 4: Remove any compatibility code for SQLite versions < 3.9.0.

If there are conditional blocks that handle older SQLite versions, those can be removed since we're dropping support for them.

Step 5: Confirm that the changes fix the issue.

I need to create a script that checks if Django now requires SQLite 3.9.0 or higher and confirm that it doesn't work with older versions.

Step 6: Consider edge cases.

I should think about scenarios where users might be using older SQLite versions and ensure that the application fails gracefully with a clear error message.

Let's start by exploring the repository structure.

<function=execute_bash>
<parameter=command>
cd /workspace/django__django__3.2 && ls

================================================================================
RESPONSE:
Okay, so the repository contains various files and directories typical of a Python project, including `django` which is the main package, `setup.py` for installation, and `docs` for documentation.

Next, I need to find where Django checks for the SQLite version. I recall that Django has a database backend for SQLite, which is likely where the version checking happens.

Let's look into the `django/db/backends/sqlite3` directory to find the version checking logic.

<function=execute_bash>

================================================================================
RESPONSE:
Great, so in the `django/db/backends/sqlite3` directory, there are several files that might be relevant. The `base.py` file is likely the main file for the SQLite backend.

I should check `base.py` to see where the SQLite version is checked.

================================================================================

Alright, that's just the beginning of the file. I need to search for version checking within this file.

Let me search for "version" or "sqlite_version" in `base.py`.

check_sqlite_version()
[Python Interpreter: /opt/miniconda3/envs/testbed/bin/python]
[Command finished with exit code 0]

================================================================================
RESPONSE:
Okay, so in `base.py`, there's a function `check_sqlite_version()` that checks if the SQLite version is at least 3.8.3. We need to update this to check for at least 3.9.0.

I'll need to modify this function to raise an `ImproperlyConfigured` error if the SQLite version is less than 3.9.0.

Also, I should look for any conditional code that handles older SQLite versions and remove it since we're dropping support for those versions.

First, let's update the `check_sqlite_version` function.

Review the changes and make sure they are as expected. Edit the file again if necessary.

================================================================================
RESPONSE:
Perfect, the version check has been updated to require SQLite 3.9.0 or later.

Now, I need to ensure that any code that provides compatibility with older SQLite versions is removed.

Let me search for any conditional code that checks for SQLite version less than 3.9.0.

================================================================================
RESPONSE:
From the search results, it looks like there are several conditional checks in `features.py` that enable or disable certain features based on the SQLite version.

Since we're dropping support for SQLite versions earlier than 3.9.0, I need to review these conditionals to see if any of them are relevant for versions below 3.9.0.

Looking at the conditionals:

- `can_alter_table_rename_column = Database.sqlite_version_info >= (3, 25, 0)`

- `supports_pragma_foreign_key_check = Database.sqlite_version_info >= (3, 20, 0)`

- `supports_functions_in_partial_indexes = Database.sqlite_version_info >= (3, 15, 0)`

- `supports_over_clause = Database.sqlite_version_info >= (3, 25, 0)`

- `supports_frame_range_fixed_distance = Database.sqlite_version_info >= (3, 28, 0)`

- `supports_aggregate_filter_clause = Database.sqlite_version_info >= (3, 30, 1)`

- `supports_order_by_nulls_modifier = Database.sqlite_version_info >= (3, 30, 0)`

- An if statement: `if Database.sqlite_version_info < (3, 27):`

- Another if statement: `if platform.mac_ver()[0].startswith('10.15.') and Database.sqlite_version_info == (3, 28, 0):`

- And a return statement: `return Database.sqlite_version_info >= (3, 26, 0)`

Given that we're dropping support for SQLite < 3.9.0, and the minimum version is now 3.9.0, I need to see if any of these conditionals are relevant for versions between 3.9.0 and the current version checks.

For example, if a feature is supported starting from SQLite 3.15.0, and our minimum version is 3.9.0, then for versions between 3.9.0 and 3.15.0, that feature isn't supported, and the conditional is necessary.

However, if a feature is supported starting from SQLite 3.8.3, and we're dropping support for versions < 3.9.0, then perhaps that conditional can be adjusted.

Wait, in this case, since our minimum version is 3.9.0, I need to see if there are any features that are only supported in SQLite >= 3.9.0, and adjust the conditionals accordingly.

But looking at the conditionals, they are checking for higher versions like 3.15.0, 3.20.0, etc., which are all greater than 3.9.0. So, for our minimum version of 3.9.0, these conditionals should still be in place because the features they enable are only available in higher SQLite versions.

Therefore, I don't think I need to remove these conditionals. Instead, I should ensure that the conditionals are correctly set for our new minimum version.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the conditionals to be relative to our new minimum version.

For example, if a feature is supported in SQLite 3.15.0, and our minimum version is 3.9.0, then I can adjust the conditional to check for SQLite version >= 3.15.0.

But in practice, since the conditionals are already set for specific versions, I think they are fine as they are.

However, I should check if there are any conditionals that assume SQLite < 3.9.0 and remove or adjust them.

Looking back at the search results, I see one if statement: `if Database.sqlite_version_info < (3, 27):`

Since our minimum version is 3.9.0, which is greater than 3.27, this conditional will always be false. Therefore, any code inside this if block is dead code and can be removed.

Similarly, the conditional `if platform.mac_ver()[0].startswith('10.15.') and Database.sqlite_version_info == (3, 28, 0):` can also be removed because our minimum version is 3.9.0, which may or may not be equal to 3.28.0, but it's better to remove conditionals for specific versions below our minimum.

So, I need to edit `features.py` to remove these conditionals.

================================================================================
RESPONSE:
From the grep results, it's clear that there are several attributes in `DatabaseFeatures` that are conditionally set based on `Database.sqlite_version_info`.

Since our minimum supported SQLite version is now 3.9.0, I need to ensure that any conditionals checking for versions below 3.9.0 are removed or adjusted.

Looking at the conditionals:

- `can_alter_table_rename_column = Database.sqlite_version_info >= (3, 25, 0)`

- `supports_pragma_foreign_key_check = Database.sqlite_version_info >= (3, 20, 0)`

- `supports_functions_in_partial_indexes = Database.sqlite_version_info >= (3, 15, 0)`

- `supports_over_clause = Database.sqlite_version_info >= (3, 25, 0)`

- `supports_frame_range_fixed_distance = Database.sqlite_version_info >= (3, 28, 0)`

- `supports_aggregate_filter_clause = Database.sqlite_version_info >= (3, 30, 1)`

- `supports_order_by_nulls_modifier = Database.sqlite_version_info >= (3, 30, 0)`

- An if statement: `if Database.sqlite_version_info < (3, 27):`

- Another if statement: `if platform.mac_ver()[0].startswith('10.15.') and Database.sqlite_version_info == (3, 28, 0):`

- A return statement: `return Database.sqlite_version_info >= (3, 26, 0)`

Given that our minimum version is 3.9.0, any conditionals checking for versions below 3.9.0 can be removed or simplified.

For example, if a feature is supported in SQLite 3.15.0 and above, and our minimum version is 3.9.0, then for versions between 3.9.0 and 3.15.0, the feature isn't supported. However, since we're dropping support for versions below 3.9.0, we can adjust the conditionals accordingly.

But in practice, since the conditionals are already set for specific versions, I think they are fine as they are.

However, the if statements that check for versions below 3.27.0 are no longer necessary because our minimum version is 3.9.0, which is higher than 3.27.0. Therefore, these if blocks can be removed.

Let me locate the if statement in the code.

So, there is an if statement that checks if `Database.sqlite_version_info < (3, 27)`. Since our minimum supported version is 3.9.0, which is greater than 3.27, this conditional will never be true. Therefore, the code inside this if block is dead code and can be removed.

I need to locate this if statement in `features.py` and remove it.

    90	        return Database.sqlite_version_info >= (3, 26, 0)


================================================================================
RESPONSE:
Ah, here's the conditional I was looking for.

In lines 88-90, there's a conditional that checks for a specific SQLite version on MacOS 10.15 and sets `supports_atomic_references_rename` accordingly.

Since our minimum supported SQLite version is 3.9.0, and this conditional is checking for a specific version (3.28.0), which is higher than 3.9.0, I need to decide whether to remove this conditional or adjust it.

Given that 3.28.0 is higher than 3.9.0, and the condition is specific to MacOS 10.15, I think it's still relevant. However, since we're dropping support for SQLite versions below 3.9.0, and 3.28.0 is well above 3.9.0, perhaps this conditional can be simplified.

But to be safe, I'll leave it as is, since it might still be necessary for that specific version.

Now, back to the original if statement that checks for `Database.sqlite_version_info < (3, 27)`.

Let me search for that specific line.

Great, the conditional has been removed.

[Command finished with exit code 0]

================================================================================
RESPONSE:
The only remaining conditional checking `Database.sqlite_version_info` is in `base.py`, where we already updated the version check to 3.9.0.

Therefore, I don't think there are any other conditionals that need to be removed.

Next, I need to ensure that any features that require SQLite 3.9.0 or later are enabled by default, and any workarounds for older versions are no longer present.

Since the PR description mentions that indexes on expressions and the SQLITE_ENABLE_JSON1 option are supported on SQLite 3.9.0+, I need to make sure that Django enables these features if they are supported by the SQLite version.

However, since we're dropping support for SQLite < 3.9.0, and assuming that all supported SQLite versions have these features, I might not need to do anything additional.

But to be thorough, I should check if there are any places in the code where Django conditionally enables these features based on the SQLite version.

Let me search for "SQLITE_ENABLE_JSON1" in the codebase.

It seems like "SQLITE_ENABLE_JSON1" is not mentioned anywhere in the codebase. Perhaps this is a compile-time option for SQLite, and Django doesn't need to handle it explicitly.

In that case, I don't need to make any changes related to this option.

Next, I need to ensure that indexes on expressions are handled correctly for SQLite 3.9.0 and later.

I should check if there's any version checking related to expression indexes in the Django code.

Let me search for "indexes on expressions" or "expression indexes" in the codebase.

In that case, since we're dropping support for SQLite < 3.9.0, and assuming that expression indexes are supported in SQLite 3.9.0 and later, I don't need to make any changes.

Now, to confirm that the changes are sufficient, I need to create a script that checks if Django now requires SQLite 3.9.0 or higher and confirm that it doesn't work with older versions.

I'll create a simple Python script that tries to connect to an SQLite database using Django and checks the SQLite version.

Provided commands:
(1) export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=sampleproject.settings
(2) python3 /workspace/check_sqlite_version.py
[Error occurred in processing last action]

================================================================================
RESPONSE:
Ah, it seems like I need to chain the commands properly.

Let me try running both commands in a single execution.

<function=execute_bash>
<parameter=command>
export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=sampleproject.settings && python3 /workspace/check_sqlite_version.py
</parameter>


---------------------------------------- OBSERVATION ----------------------------------------
EXECUTION RESULT of [execute_bash]:
Error: No module named 'sampleproject'
[Python Interpreter: /opt/miniconda3/envs/testbed/bin/python]
[Command finished with exit code 1]

================================================================================
RESPONSE:
The error indicates that the module `sampleproject` cannot be found. This suggests that the Python path is not set correctly to include the directory containing `sampleproject`.

I need to make sure that the Python path includes the directory where `sampleproject` is located.

Let me navigate to the `tests/i18n/sampleproject` directory and set the Python path accordingly.

<function=execute_bash>
<parameter=command>
cd /workspace/django__django__3.2/tests/i18n/sampleproject && \
export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=sampleproject.settings && \
python3 /workspace/check_sqlite_version.py
</parameter>


---------------------------------------- OBSERVATION ----------------------------------------
EXECUTION RESULT of [execute_bash]:
Error: No module named 'sampleproject'
[Python Interpreter: /opt/miniconda3/envs/testbed/bin/python]
[Command finished with exit code 1]

================================================================================
RESPONSE:
It seems like Python can't find the `sampleproject` module even after changing to its directory. Perhaps I need to adjust the Python path explicitly.

Let me try adding the current directory to the Python path.

<function=execute_bash>
<parameter=command>
cd /workspace/django__django__3.2/tests/i18n/sampleproject && \
export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=sampleproject.settings && \
export PYTHONPATH=/workspace/django__django__3.2 && \
python3 /workspace/check_sqlite_version.py
</parameter>

================================================================================
LAST RESPONSE:
Still having issues with Python not finding the `sampleproject` module. Maybe I need to adjust the way I'm setting the `PYTHONPATH`.

Let me try including the parent directory of `sampleproject` in the `PYTHONPATH`.

<function=execute_bash>
<parameter=command>
cd /workspace/django__django__3.2/tests/i18n && \
export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=sampleproject.settings && \
export PYTHONPATH=/workspace/django__django__3.2:/workspace/django__django__3.2/tests/i18n && \
python3 /workspace/check_sqlite_version.py
</parameter>
