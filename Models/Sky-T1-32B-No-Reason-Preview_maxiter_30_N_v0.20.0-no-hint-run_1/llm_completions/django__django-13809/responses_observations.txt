INITIAL ISSUE:
################################################################################
You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.
<IMPORTANT>
* If user provides a path, you should NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. Instead, you should explore the file system to find the file before working on it.
* When configuring git credentials, use "openhands" as the user.name and "openhands@all-hands.dev" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
* The assistant MUST NOT include comments in the code unless they are necessary to describe non-obvious behavior.
</IMPORTANT>
You have access to the following functions:

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #1: execute_bash ----
Description: Execute a bash command in the terminal.
* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, it should be run in the background and the output should be redirected to a file, e.g. command = `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`.
* Interactive: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. The assistant must then send a second call to terminal with an empty `command` (which will retrieve any additional logs), or it can send additional text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process, or it can send command like `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the process.

Parameters:
  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty string to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the currently running process.
---- END FUNCTION #1 ----

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: finish ----
Description: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.
No parameters are required for this function.
---- END FUNCTION #2 ----

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----
Description: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files
* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user
* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep
* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file
* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`
* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`

Notes for using the `str_replace` command:
* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!
* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique
* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`

Parameters:
  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.
Allowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]
  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/workspace/file.py` or `/workspace`.
  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.
  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.
  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.
  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.
  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.
---- END FUNCTION #3 ----

--------------------- NEW TASK DESCRIPTION ---------------------
<uploaded_files>
/workspace/django__django__4.0
</uploaded_files>
I've uploaded a python code repository in the directory django__django__4.0. Consider the following PR description:

<pr_description>
Add --skip-checks option to the runserver command.
Description
	
Rationale:
It would be consistent with other management commands performing system checks
It would help people like me who would rather have checks enabled exclusively in CI/CD than wait 15-20 seconds for each project reload during development
Related StackOverflow question:
​https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41438593/skip-system-checks-on-django-server-in-debug-mode-in-pycharm/41725866

</pr_description>

Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?
I've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!
Your task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /workspace directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.
Follow these steps to resolve the issue:
1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.
2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error
3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue
4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!
5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well
Your thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.

================================================================================
RESPONSE:
Alright, I've got this task to implement a `--skip-checks` option for Django's `runserver` command. I need to make sure that this option behaves consistently with other management commands that perform system checks and also aligns with the user's preference to have checks enabled exclusively in CI/CD, not during development.

First, I need to understand the current behavior of the `runserver` command in Django. Typically, when you run `python manage.py runserver`, Django performs a series of system checks to ensure that everything is set up correctly before starting the development server. These checks can be time-consuming, especially in large projects, which is why the user wants an option to skip them during development.

The user referenced a StackOverflow question where someone was looking for a way to skip system checks in debug mode, particularly in PyCharm. This suggests that there might already be some demand for such a feature.

My task is to add a `--skip-checks` option to the `runserver` command. This option should allow users to skip the system checks when starting the server, making the development process faster.

Given that I have a Django repository in `/workspace/django__django__4.0`, I need to navigate to that directory and explore the code structure to find where the `runserver` command is defined and how the system checks are performed.

I should start by familiarizing myself with the Django project structure. Typically, in a Django project, management commands are located in the `management/commands` directory within an app. However, since this is the Django framework repository itself, the structure might be different.

Let me first list the contents of the `/workspace/django__django__4.0` directory to understand its structure.

<function=execute_bash>
<parameter=command>
ls /workspace/django__django__4.0
</parameter>

[Command finished with exit code 0]

================================================================================
RESPONSE:
Okay, so the `/workspace/django__django__4.0` directory contains various files and directories typical of a Python project, including `django` which is likely the source code directory, `docs` for documentation, `tests` for tests, and other metadata files.

I need to find where the `runserver` management command is defined. In Django, management commands are usually located in the `django/core/management/commands` directory.

Let me navigate to the `django` directory and look for the `core/management/commands` path.

<function=execute_bash>
<parameter=command>ls /workspace/django__django__4.0/django/core/management/commands</parameter>

================================================================================
RESPONSE:
Great, the `runserver.py` file is present in the `django/core/management/commands` directory. This is where the `runserver` management command is defined.

I need to modify this file to include a new option `--skip-checks` that, when provided, skips the system checks that Django normally performs before starting the development server.

First, I should look into how the `runserver` command is currently implemented. I need to open and read the `runserver.py` file to understand its structure.

RESPONSE:
Alright, I've looked at the `runserver.py` file. It defines a `Command` class that inherits from `BaseCommand`. The `handle` method is where the server starts, and it includes system checks before starting the server.

To add a `--skip-checks` option, I need to do the following:

1. **Add the option to the command:** Modify the `add_arguments` method to include the new `--skip-checks` option.

2. **Handle the option in the code:** Modify the `handle` or `inner_run` method to skip system checks if the `--skip-checks` option is provided.

First, I'll add the `--skip-checks` option to the `add_arguments` method.

I need to edit the `add_arguments` method to include a new argument for `--skip-checks`.

RESPONSE:
Hmm, it seems like the `old_str` I provided didn't match exactly what's in the file. Maybe there are some differences in spacing or formatting. Let me check the original code again.

Looking back at line 50 of `runserver.py`:

```python
50     parser.add_argument(
51         '--noreload', action='store_false', dest='use_reloader',
52         help='Tells Django to NOT use the auto-reloader.',
53     )
```

I need to make sure that the string I'm replacing matches exactly, including spaces and line breaks.

Let me try again with a more precise match.

RESPONSE:
It seems like there's still a mismatch between the `old_str` and the actual content in the file. Maybe there are some invisible characters or differences in indentation.

Let me try to specify a smaller portion of the code to match, to avoid any formatting issues.

I'll try to replace just the closing parenthesis of the `--noreload` argument and add the new argument right after it.

Please ensure it is unique.

================================================================================
RESPONSE:
Okay, that didn't work because the old string `)` appears multiple times in the file. I need to find a more unique string to replace.

Let me try to find a unique section to add the new argument. Maybe I can look for the entire block of `add_arguments` and add the new argument within that method.

First, I'll locate the `add_arguments` method in the file.

Lines 37-54 define the `add_arguments` method.

I need to add the new argument right before the closing `)` of the `add_arguments` method.

But since there are multiple `)` in the file, I need to be precise.

Alternatively, I can add the new argument right after the existing arguments.

Let me try to find a unique string within the `add_arguments` method and add the new argument after it.

Looking at line 50:

```python
parser.add_argument(
    '--noreload', action='store_false', dest='use_reloader',
    help='Tells Django to NOT use the auto-reloader.',
)
```

I'll use this as the `old_str` and append the new argument right after it.

But since that didn't work earlier, maybe I need to include more context.

Let me try to match a larger block of code to ensure uniqueness.

================================================================================
RESPONSE:
It seems like no matter what I try, the replacement isn't being performed because the `old_str` isn't matching exactly. Maybe there's an issue with the way the string is being interpreted.

Let me try a different approach. Perhaps I can add the new argument in a different part of the `add_arguments` method to ensure uniqueness.

Let me look for the beginning of the `add_arguments` method and add the new argument there.

Looking at line 37:

```python
37     def add_arguments(self, parser):
38         parser.add_argument(
39             'addrport', nargs='?',
40             help='Optional port number, or ipaddr:port'
41         )
42         parser.add_argument(
43             '--ipv6', '-6', action='store_true', dest='use_ipv6',
44             help='Tells Django to use an IPv6 address.',
45         )
46         parser.add_argument(
47             '--nothreading', action='store_false', dest='use_threading',
48             help='Tells Django to NOT use threading.',
49         )
50         parser.add_argument(

52             help='Tells Django to NOT use the auto-reloader.',
53         )
```

I'll try adding the `--skip-checks` argument right after the `--noreload` argument.

But since that's not working, maybe I need to specify a different `old_str` that is unique.

Let me try to replace the entire `add_arguments` method with the new argument included.

First, I'll copy the entire `add_arguments` method, add the new argument, and then replace the old method with the new one.
