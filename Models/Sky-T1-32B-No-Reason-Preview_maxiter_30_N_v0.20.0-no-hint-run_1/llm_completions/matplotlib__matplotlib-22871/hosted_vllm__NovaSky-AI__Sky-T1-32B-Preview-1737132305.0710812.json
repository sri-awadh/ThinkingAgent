Instead, you should explore the file system to find the file before working on it.\n* When configuring git credentials, use \"openhands\" as the user.name and \"openhands@all-hands.dev\" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* The assistant MUST NOT include comments in the code unless they are necessary to describe non-obvious behavior.\n</IMPORTANT>\nYou have access to the following functions:\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #1: execute_bash ----\nDescription: Execute a bash command in the terminal.\n* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, it should be run in the background and the output should be redirected to a file, e.g. command = `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`.\n* Interactive: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. The assistant must then send a second call to terminal with an empty `command` (which will retrieve any additional logs), or it can send additional text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process, or it can send command like `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the process.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty string to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the currently running process.\n---- END FUNCTION #1 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: finish ----\nDescription: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.\nNo parameters are required for this function.\n---- END FUNCTION #2 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----\nDescription: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files\n* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user\n* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n\nNotes for using the `str_replace` command:\n* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!\n* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique\n* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\nAllowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]\n  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/workspace/file.py` or `/workspace`.\n  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\n  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\n  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.\n  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.\n  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start.

This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /workspace directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5.

Do not modify.\n* You may already be on a branch starting with `openhands-workspace`. Create a new branch with a better name before pushing.\n* Use the GitHub API to create a pull request, if you haven't already\n* Once you've created your own branch or a pull request, continue to update it. Do NOT create a new one unless you are explicitly asked to. Update the PR title and description as necessary, but don't change the branch name.\n* Use the main branch as the base branch, unless the user requests otherwise\n* After opening or updating a pull request, send the user a short message with a link to the pull request.\n* Prefer \"Draft\" pull requests when possible\n* Do all of the above in as few steps as possible. E.g. you could open a PR with one step by running the following bash commands:\n```bash\ngit remote -v && git branch # to find the current org, repo and branch\ngit checkout -b create-widget && git add . && git commit -m \"Create widget\" && git push -u origin create-widget\ncurl -X POST \"https://api.github.com/repos/$ORG_NAME/$REPO_NAME/pulls\" \\\n    -H \"Authorization: Bearer $GITHUB_TOKEN\" \\\n    -d '{\"title\":\"Create widget\",\"head\":\"create-widget\",\"base\":\"openhands-workspace\"}'\n```\n</extra_info>\n--------------------- END OF NEW TASK DESCRIPTION ---------------------\n\nPLEASE follow the format strictly!

To convert old\n    48\t   ordinal floats to the new epoch, users can do::\n    49\t\n    50\t     new_ordinal = old_ordinal + mdates.date2num(np.datetime64('0000-12-31'))\n    51\t\n    52\t\n    53\tThere are a number of helper functions to convert between :mod:`datetime`\n    54\tobjects and Matplotlib dates:\n    55\t\n    56\t.. currentmodule:: matplotlib.dates\n    57\t\n    58\t.. autosummary::\n    59\t   :nosignatures:\n    60\t\n    61\t   datestr2num\n    62\t   date2num\n    63\t   num2date\n    64\t   num2timedelta\n    65\t   drange\n    66\t   set_epoch\n    67\t   get_epoch\n    68\t\n    69\t.. note::\n    70\t\n    71\t   Like Python's `datetime.datetime`, Matplotlib uses the Gregorian calendar\n    72\t   for all conversions between dates and floating point numbers. This practice\n    73\t   is not universal, and calendar differences can cause confusing\n    74\t   differences between what Python and Matplotlib give as the number of days\n    75\t   since 0001-01-01 and what other software and databases yield.  For\n    76\t   example, the US Naval Observatory uses a calendar that switches\n    77\t   from Julian to Gregorian in October, 1582.  Hence, using their\n    78\t   calculator, the number of days between 0001-01-01 and 2006-04-01 is\n    79\t   732403, whereas using the Gregorian calendar via the datetime\n    80\t   module we find::\n    81\t\n    82\t     In [1]: date(2006, 4, 1).toordinal() - date(1, 1, 1).toordinal()\n    83\t     Out[1]: 732401\n    84\t\n    85\tAll the Matplotlib date converters, tickers and formatters are timezone aware.\n    86\tIf no explicit timezone is provided, :rc:`timezone` is assumed, provided as a\n    87\tstring.  If you want to use a different timezone, pass the *tz* keyword\n    88\targument of `num2date` to any date tickers or locators you create.  This can\n    89\tbe either a `datetime.tzinfo` instance or a string with the timezone name that\n    90\tcan be parsed by `~dateutil.tz.gettz`.\n    91\t\n    92\tA wide range of specific and general purpose date tick locators and\n    93\tformatters are provided in this module.  See\n    94\t:mod:`matplotlib.ticker` for general information on tick locators\n    95\tand formatters.  These are described below.\n    96\t\n    97\tThe dateutil_ module provides additional code to handle date ticking, making it\n    98\teasy to place ticks on any kinds of dates.  See examples below.\n    99\t\n   100\t.. _dateutil: https://dateutil.readthedocs.io\n   101\t\n   102\tDate tickers\n   103\t------------\n   104\t\n   105\tMost of the date tickers can locate single or multiple values.  For example::\n   106\t\n   107\t    # import constants for the days of the week\n   108\t    from matplotlib.dates import MO, TU, WE, TH, FR, SA, SU\n   109\t\n   110\t    # tick on mondays every week\n   111\t    loc = WeekdayLocator(byweekday=MO, tz=tz)\n   112\t\n   113\t    # tick on mondays and saturdays\n   114\t    loc = WeekdayLocator(byweekday=(MO, SA))\n   115\t\n   116\tIn addition, most of the constructors take an interval argument::\n   117\t\n   118\t    # tick on mondays every second week\n   119\t    loc = WeekdayLocator(byweekday=MO, interval=2)\n   120\t\n   121\tThe rrule locator allows completely general date ticking::\n   122\t\n   123\t    # tick every 5th easter\n   124\t    rule = rrulewrapper(YEARLY, byeaster=1, interval=5)\n   125\t    loc = RRuleLocator(rule)\n   126\t\n   127\tThe available date tickers are:\n   128\t\n   129\t* `MicrosecondLocator`: Locate microseconds.\n   130\t\n   131\t* `SecondLocator`: Locate seconds.\n   132\t\n   133\t* `MinuteLocator`: Locate minutes.\n   134\t\n   135\t* `HourLocator`: Locate hours.\n   136\t\n   137\t* `DayLocator`: Locate specified days of the month.\n   138\t\n   139\t* `WeekdayLocator`: Locate days of the week, e.g., MO, TU.\n   140\t\n   141\t* `MonthLocator`: Locate months, e.g., 7 for July.\n   142\t\n   143\t* `YearLocator`: Locate years that are multiples of base.\n   144\t\n   145\t* `RRuleLocator`: Locate using a ``matplotlib.dates.rrulewrapper``.\n   146\t  ``rrulewrapper`` is a simple wrapper around dateutil_'s `dateutil.rrule`\n   147\t  which allow almost arbitrary date tick specifications.\n   148\t  See :doc:`rrule example </gallery/ticks/date_demo_rrule>`.\n   149\t\n   150\t* `AutoDateLocator`: On autoscale, this class picks the best `DateLocator`\n   151\t  (e.g., `RRuleLocator`) to set the view limits and the tick locations.  If\n   152\t  called with ``interval_multiples=True`` it will make ticks line up with\n   153\t  sensible multiples of the tick intervals.  E.g. if the interval is 4 hours,\n   154\t  it will pick hours 0, 4, 8, etc as ticks.  This behaviour is not guaranteed\n   155\t  by default.\n   156\t\n   157\tDate formatters\n   158\t---------------\n   159\t\n   160\tThe available date formatters are:\n   161\t\n   162\t* `AutoDateFormatter`: attempts to figure out the best format to use.  This is\n   163\t  most useful when used with the `AutoDateLocator`.\n   164\t\n   165\t* `ConciseDateFormatter`: also attempts to figure out the best format to use,\n   166\t  and to make the format as compact as possible while still having complete\n   167\t  date information.  This is most useful when used with the `AutoDateLocator`.\n   168\t\n   169\t* `DateFormatter`: use `~datetime.datetime.strftime` format strings.\n   170\t\"\"\"\n   171\t\n   172\timport datetime\n   173\timport functools\n   174\timport logging\n   175\timport math\n   176\t\n   177\tfrom dateutil.rrule import (rrule, MO, TU, WE, TH, FR, SA, SU, YEARLY,\n   178\t                            MONTHLY, WEEKLY, DAILY, HOURLY, MINUTELY,\n   179\t                            SECONDLY)\n   180\tfrom dateutil.relativedelta import relativedelta\n   181\timport dateutil.parser\n   182\timport dateutil.tz\n   183\timport numpy as np\n   184\t\n   185\timport matplotlib as mpl\n   186\tfrom matplotlib import _api, cbook, ticker, units\n   187\t\n   188\t__all__ = ('datestr2num', 'date2num', 'num2date', 'num2timedelta', 'drange',\n   189\t           'epoch2num', 'num2epoch', 'set_epoch', 'get_epoch', 'DateFormatter',\n   190\t           'ConciseDateFormatter', 'AutoDateFormatter',\n   191\t           'DateLocator', 'RRuleLocator', 'AutoDateLocator', 'YearLocator',\n   192\t           'MonthLocator', 'WeekdayLocator',\n   193\t           'DayLocator', 'HourLocator', 'MinuteLocator',\n   194\t           'SecondLocator', 'MicrosecondLocator',\n   195\t           'rrule', 'MO', 'TU', 'WE', 'TH', 'FR', 'SA', 'SU',\n   196\t           'YEARLY', 'MONTHLY', 'WEEKLY', 'DAILY',\n   197\t           'HOURLY', 'MINUTELY', 'SECONDLY', 'MICROSECONDLY', 'relativedelta',\n   198\t           'DateConverter', 'ConciseDateConverter')\n   199\t\n   200\t\n   201\t_log = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n   202\tUTC = datetime.timezone.utc\n   203\t\n   204\t\n   205\tdef _get_tzinfo(tz=None):\n   206\t    \"\"\"\n   207\t    Generate tzinfo from a string or return tzinfo.

Specifically, it uses `tickdatetime[-1].strftime(offsetfmts[level])` to generate the offset string.\n\nGiven that the user expects the year to show up in the offset when plotting less than 12 months of data, but it doesn't, it's likely that the level is being set to a higher granularity (e.g., months or days) where the year is not included in the offset format by default.\n\nLooking at the default `offset_formats`, they are:\n\n- Level 0: ''\n- Level 1: '%Y'\n- Level 2: '%Y-%b'\n- Level 3: '%Y-%b-%d'\n- Level 4: '%Y-%b-%d'\n- Level 5: '%Y-%b-%d %H:%M'\n\nSo, for levels 2 and above, the year is included in the offset format. However, in the user's case, when plotting less than a year's data without January, the level might be set to 2 (days), which should include the year in the offset.\n\nBut apparently, it's not showing the year. This suggests that there might be an issue with how the level is determined or how the offset string is being set.\n\nI need to investigate further to understand why the year is not being displayed in the offset in this specific scenario.\n\nLet me look at how the level is determined.\n\nIn the code, the level is determined by iterating from the highest level (5: seconds) down to the lowest level (0: years), and selecting the first level where there is more than one unique value in the date data.\n\nSpecifically, this part of the code:\n\n```python\nfor level in range(5, -1, -1):\n    if len(np.unique(tickdate[:, level])) > 1:\n        if level < 2:\n            show_offset = False\n        break\n    elif level == 0:\n        # all tickdate are the same, so only micros might be different\n        # set to the most precise (6: microseconds doesn't exist...)\n        level = 5\n```\n\nSo, if the date data has more than one unique year, it will set level to 0 (years). If years are the same but months vary, level 1 (months). If months are the same but days vary, level 2 (days), and so on.\n\nIn the user's case, since the date range is less than a year and doesn't include January, the years should be the same, and months vary, so level should be 1 (months), which should include the year in the offset.\n\nBut it's not showing the year, so perhaps there's an issue with how the offset string is being generated or displayed.\n\nLet me check the `show_offset` variable. It's set to `True` by default, and in the loop above, it's set to `False` if `level < 2`. So for `level == 1` (months), `show_offset` should be `True`.\n\nThen, in the code, it sets the offset string using `tickdatetime[-1].strftime(offsetfmts[level])`.\n\nFor `level == 1`, `offsetfmts[1]` is `'%Y'`, so it should just show the year.\n\nBut in the user's case, it's not showing the year. Maybe there's a problem with the tick data or how the formatter is being used.\n\nI need to think about edge cases. One possibility is that when the date range doesn't include January, the formatter assumes that the year is already clear from the month labels, but that's not the case here.\n\nPerhaps I need to modify the formatter to always include the year in the offset when the date range is less than a year, regardless of whether January is included or not.\n\nTo do that, I could adjust the logic that determines the offset format based on the level.\n\nLet me consider modifying the `offset_formats` for level 1 (months) to include the year, even if it's already included in the tick labels.\n\nBut from the code, it seems that `offset_formats[1]` is `'%Y'`, which should just show the year in the offset.\n\nMaybe the issue is that the year is being displayed, but it's being clipped or not shown due to some other reason.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formatter is not being applied correctly, or there's a bug in how the offset string is being set or displayed.\n\nI need to test this by running the provided code snippet and observing the output.\n\nSince I don't have a graphical interface here, I can't see the plot directly, but I can run the script and check the output.\n\nEarlier, I created a script `/workspace/reproduce_bug.py` to reproduce the issue.

The formatters and\n    35\tlocators require the use of `datetime.datetime` objects, so only dates between\n    36\tyear 0001 and 9999 can be represented.  Microsecond precision\n    37\tis achievable for (approximately) 70 years on either side of the epoch, and\n    38\t20 microseconds for the rest of the allowable range of dates (year 0001 to\n    39\t9999). The epoch can be changed at import time via `.dates.set_epoch` or\n    40\t:rc:`dates.epoch` to other dates if necessary; see\n    41\t:doc:`/gallery/ticks/date_precision_and_epochs` for a discussion.\n    42\t\n    43\t.. note::\n    44\t\n    45\t   Before Matplotlib 3.3, the epoch was 0000-12-31 which lost modern\n    46\t   microsecond precision and also made the default axis limit of 0 an invalid\n    47\t   datetime.  In 3.3 the epoch was changed as above.  To convert old\n    48\t   ordinal floats to the new epoch, users can do::\n    49\t\n    50\t     new_ordinal = old_ordinal + mdates.date2num(np.datetime64('0000-12-31'))\n    51\t\n    52\t\n    53\tThere are a number of helper functions to convert between :mod:`datetime`\n    54\tobjects and Matplotlib dates:\n    55\t\n    56\t.. currentmodule:: matplotlib.dates\n    57\t\n    58\t.. autosummary::\n    59\t   :nosignatures:\n    60\t\n    61\t   datestr2num\n    62\t   date2num\n    63\t   num2date\n    64\t   num2timedelta\n    65\t   drange\n    66\t   set_epoch\n    67\t   get_epoch\n    68\t\n    69\t.. note::\n    70\t\n    71\t   Like Python's `datetime.datetime`, Matplotlib uses the Gregorian calendar\n    72\t   for all conversions between dates and floating point numbers. This practice\n    73\t   is not universal, and calendar differences can cause confusing\n    74\t   differences between what Python and Matplotlib give as the number of days\n    75\t   since 0001-01-01 and what other software and databases yield.  For\n    76\t   example, the US Naval Observatory uses a calendar that switches\n    77\t   from Julian to Gregorian in October, 1582.  Hence, using their\n    78\t   calculator, the number of days between 0001-01-01 and 2006-04-01 is\n    79\t   732403, whereas using the Gregorian calendar via the datetime\n    80\t   module we find::\n    81\t\n    82\t     In [1]: date(2006, 4, 1).toordinal() - date(1, 1, 1).toordinal()\n    83\t     Out[1]: 732401\n    84\t\n    85\tAll the Matplotlib date converters, tickers and formatters are timezone aware.\n    86\tIf no explicit timezone is provided, :rc:`timezone` is assumed, provided as a\n    87\tstring.  If you want to use a different timezone, pass the *tz* keyword\n    88\targument of `num2date` to any date tickers or locators you create.  This can\n    89\tbe either a `datetime.tzinfo` instance or a string with the timezone name that\n    90\tcan be parsed by `~dateutil.tz.gettz`.\n    91\t\n    92\tA wide range of specific and general purpose date tick locators and\n    93\tformatters are provided in this module.  See\n    94\t:mod:`matplotlib.ticker` for general information on tick locators\n    95\tand formatters.  These are described below.\n    96\t\n    97\tThe dateutil_ module provides additional code to handle date ticking, making it\n    98\teasy to place ticks on any kinds of dates.  See examples below.\n    99\t\n   100\t.. _dateutil: https://dateutil.readthedocs.io\n   101\t\n   102\tDate tickers\n   103\t------------\n   104\t\n   105\tMost of the date tickers can locate single or multiple values.

If\n   152\t  called with ``interval_multiples=True`` it will make ticks line up with\n   153\t  sensible multiples of the tick intervals.  E.g. if the interval is 4 hours,\n   154\t  it will pick hours 0, 4, 8, etc as ticks.

Probably, it has some rules based on the date range being plotted.\n\nLet me view the code around line 642 to understand the class implementation.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"id": "toolu_09", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "str_replace_editor", "arguments": "{\"command\": \"view\", \"path\": \"/workspace/matplotlib__matplotlib__3.5/lib/matplotlib/dates.py\", \"view_range\": [600, 700]}"}}]}, {"content": "Here's the result of running `cat -n` on /workspace/matplotlib__matplotlib__3.5/lib/matplotlib/dates.py:\n   600\t    f2 = date2num(dinterval_end)  # new float-endpoint\n   601\t    return np.linspace(f1, f2, num + 1)\n   602\t\n   603\t\n   604\tdef _wrap_in_tex(text):\n   605\t    return r\"{\\fontfamily{\\familydefault}\\selectfont \" + text + \"}\"\n   606\t\n   607\t\n   608\t## date tickers and formatters ###\n   609\t\n   610\t\n   611\tclass DateFormatter(ticker.Formatter):\n   612\t    \"\"\"\n   613\t    Format a tick (in days since the epoch) with a\n   614\t    `~datetime.datetime.strftime` format string.\n   615\t    \"\"\"\n   616\t\n   617\t    def __init__(self, fmt, tz=None, *, usetex=None):\n   618\t        \"\"\"\n   619\t        Parameters\n   620\t        ----------\n   621\t        fmt : str\n   622\t            `~datetime.datetime.strftime` format string\n   623\t        tz : str or `~datetime.tzinfo`, default: :rc:`timezone`\n   624\t            Ticks timezone.\n   625\t        usetex : bool, default: :rc:`text.usetex`\n   626\t            To enable/disable the use of TeX's math mode for rendering the\n   627\t            results of the formatter.\n   628\t        \"\"\"\n   629\t        self.tz = _get_tzinfo(tz)\n   630\t        self.fmt = fmt\n   631\t        self._usetex = (usetex if usetex is not None else\n   632\t                        mpl.rcParams['text.usetex'])\n   633\t\n   634\t    def __call__(self, x, pos=0):\n   635\t        result = num2date(x, self.tz).strftime(self.fmt)\n   636\t        return _wrap_in_tex(result) if self._usetex else result\n   637\t\n   638\t    def set_tzinfo(self, tz):\n   639\t        self.tz = _get_tzinfo(tz)\n   640\t\n   641\t\n   642\tclass ConciseDateFormatter(ticker.Formatter):\n   643\t    \"\"\"\n   644\t    A `.Formatter` which attempts to figure out the best format to use for the\n   645\t    date, and to make it as compact as possible, but still be complete.

Specifically, it uses `tickdatetime[-1].strftime(offsetfmts[level])` to generate the offset string.\n\nGiven that the user expects the year to show up in the offset when plotting less than 12 months of data, but it doesn't, it's likely that the level is being set to a higher granularity (e.g., months or days) where the year is not included in the offset format by default.\n\nLooking at the default `offset_formats`, they are:\n\n- Level 0: ''\n- Level 1: '%Y'\n- Level 2: '%Y-%b'\n- Level 3: '%Y-%b-%d'\n- Level 4: '%Y-%b-%d'\n- Level 5: '%Y-%b-%d %H:%M'\n\nSo, for levels 2 and above, the year is included in the offset format. However, in the user's case, when plotting less than a year's data without January, the level might be set to 2 (days), which should include the year in the offset.\n\nBut apparently, it's not showing the year. This suggests that there might be an issue with how the level is determined or how the offset string is being set.\n\nI need to investigate further to understand why the year is not being displayed in the offset in this specific scenario.\n\nLet me look at how the level is determined.\n\nIn the code, the level is determined by iterating from the highest level (5: seconds) down to the lowest level (0: years), and selecting the first level where there is more than one unique value in the date data.\n\nSpecifically, this part of the code:\n\n```python\nfor level in range(5, -1, -1):\n    if len(np.unique(tickdate[:, level])) > 1:\n        if level < 2:\n            show_offset = False\n        break\n    elif level == 0:\n        # all tickdate are the same, so only micros might be different\n        # set to the most precise (6: microseconds doesn't exist...)\n        level = 5\n```\n\nSo, if the date data has more than one unique year, it will set level to 0 (years). If years are the same but months vary, level 1 (months). If months are the same but days vary, level 2 (days), and so on.\n\nIn the user's case, since the date range is less than a year and doesn't include January, the years should be the same, and months vary, so level should be 1 (months), which should include the year in the offset.\n\nBut it's not showing the year, so perhaps there's an issue with how the offset string is being generated or displayed.\n\nLet me check the `show_offset` variable. It's set to `True` by default, and in the loop above, it's set to `False` if `level < 2`. So for `level == 1` (months), `show_offset` should be `True`.\n\nThen, in the code, it sets the offset string using `tickdatetime[-1].strftime(offsetfmts[level])`.\n\nFor `level == 1`, `offsetfmts[1]` is `'%Y'`, so it should just show the year.\n\nBut in the user's case, it's not showing the year. Maybe there's a problem with the tick data or how the formatter is being used.\n\nI need to think about edge cases. One possibility is that when the date range doesn't include January, the formatter assumes that the year is already clear from the month labels, but that's not the case here.\n\nPerhaps I need to modify the formatter to always include the year in the offset when the date range is less than a year, regardless of whether January is included or not.\n\nTo do that, I could adjust the logic that determines the offset format based on the level.\n\nLet me consider modifying the `offset_formats` for level 1 (months) to include the year, even if it's already included in the tick labels.\n\nBut from the code, it seems that `offset_formats[1]` is `'%Y'`, which should just show the year in the offset.\n\nMaybe the issue is that the year is being displayed, but it's being clipped or not shown due to some other reason.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formatter is not being applied correctly, or there's a bug in how the offset string is being set or displayed.\n\nI need to test this by running the provided code snippet and observing the output.\n\nSince I don't have a graphical interface here, I can't see the plot directly, but I can run the script and check the output.\n\nEarlier, I created a script `/workspace/reproduce_bug.py` to reproduce the issue.
