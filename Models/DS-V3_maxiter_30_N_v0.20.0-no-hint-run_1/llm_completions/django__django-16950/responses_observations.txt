INITIAL ISSUE:
################################################################################
You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.
<IMPORTANT>
* If user provides a path, you should NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. Instead, you should explore the file system to find the file before working on it.
* When configuring git credentials, use "openhands" as the user.name and "openhands@all-hands.dev" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
* The assistant MUST NOT include comments in the code unless they are necessary to describe non-obvious behavior.
RuntimeInfo(available_hosts={})
</IMPORTANT>
You have access to the following functions:

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #1: execute_bash ----
Description: Execute a bash command in the terminal.
* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, it should be run in the background and the output should be redirected to a file, e.g. command = `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`.
* Interactive: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. The assistant must then send a second call to terminal with an empty `command` (which will retrieve any additional logs), or it can send additional text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process, or it can send command like `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the process.

Parameters:
  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty string to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the currently running process.
---- END FUNCTION #1 ----

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: finish ----
Description: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.
No parameters are required for this function.
---- END FUNCTION #2 ----

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----
Description: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files
* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user
* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep
* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file
* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`
* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`

Notes for using the `str_replace` command:
* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!
* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique
* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`

Parameters:
  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.
Allowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]
  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/workspace/file.py` or `/workspace`.
  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.
  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.
  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.
  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.
  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.
---- END FUNCTION #3 ----


If you choose to call a function ONLY reply in the following format with NO suffix:

<function=example_function_name>
<parameter=example_parameter_1>value_1</parameter>
<parameter=example_parameter_2>
This is the value for the second parameter
that can span
multiple lines
</parameter>
</function>

<IMPORTANT>
Reminder:
- Function calls MUST follow the specified format, start with <function= and end with </function>
- Required parameters MUST be specified
- Only call one function at a time
- You may provide optional reasoning for your function call in natural language BEFORE the function call, but NOT after.
- If there is no function call available, answer the question like normal with your current knowledge and do not tell the user about function calls


Here's a running example of how to perform a task with the provided tools.

--------------------- START OF EXAMPLE ---------------------

USER: Create a list of numbers from 1 to 10, and display them in a web page at port 5000.

ASSISTANT: Sure! Let me first check the current directory:
<function=execute_bash>
<parameter=command>
pwd && ls
</parameter>
</function>

USER: EXECUTION RESULT of [execute_bash]:
/workspace
openhands@runtime:~/workspace$

ASSISTANT: There is no `app.py` file in the current directory. Let me create a Python file `app.py`:
<function=str_replace_editor>
<parameter=command>create</parameter>
<parameter=path>/workspace/app.py</parameter>
<parameter=file_text>
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    numbers = list(range(1, 11))
    return str(numbers)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(port=5000)
</parameter>
</function>

USER: EXECUTION RESULT of [str_replace_editor]:
File created successfully at: /workspace/app.py

ASSISTANT: I have created a Python file `app.py` that will display a list of numbers from 1 to 10 when you run it. Let me run the Python file for you:
<function=execute_bash>
<parameter=command>
python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &
</parameter>
</function>

USER: EXECUTION RESULT of [execute_bash]:
[1] 121
[1]+  Exit 1                  python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1

ASSISTANT: Looks like the server is running with PID 121 then crashed. Let me check the server log:
<function=execute_bash>
<parameter=command>
cat server.log
</parameter>
</function>

USER: EXECUTION RESULT of [execute_bash]:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/workspace/app.py", line 2, in <module>
    from flask import Flask
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'flask'

ASSISTANT: Looks like the server crashed because the `flask` module is not installed. Let me install the `flask` module for you:
<function=execute_bash>
<parameter=command>
pip3 install flask
</parameter>
</function>

--------------------- NEW TASK DESCRIPTION ---------------------
<uploaded_files>
/workspace/django__django__5.0
</uploaded_files>
I've uploaded a python code repository in the directory django__django__5.0. Consider the following PR description:

<pr_description>
Django Admin with Inlines not using UUIDField default value
Description
	 
		(last modified by Joseph Metzinger)
	 
Hello,
I am a long time django user, first time bug reporter, so please let me know if I need to do anything else to help get this bug fixed :)
I am using Django 3.1.3 and python 3.8.5 and have cerated a toy project to illustrate the bug. I have the following models:
class UUIDModel(models.Model):
	pkid = models.BigAutoField(primary_key=True, editable=False)
	id = models.UUIDField(default=uuid.uuid4, editable=False, unique=True)
	class Meta:
		abstract = True
class Thing(UUIDModel):
	name = models.CharField(max_length=191)
class SubThing(models.Model):
	name = models.CharField(max_length=191)
	thing = models.ForeignKey(
		'bugapp.Thing',
		to_field='id',
		on_delete = models.CASCADE,
		related_name='subthings',
	)
And the following admin.py file:
class SubThingInline(admin.StackedInline):
	model = SubThing
@admin.register(Thing)
class ThingAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
	list_display = ('name',)
	ordering = ('pkid',)
	inlines = (SubThingInline,)
When logging into the admin, if you delete all of the entries for "subthings", add a name, and save the model, it will work. As soon as you try to add a subthing alongside the main Thing, it fails with the following exception:
​https://dpaste.com/8EU4FF6RW
It shows that the value of "id" in the Thing model is being set to null.
I believe this is a bug in django.
Thanks!

</pr_description>

Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?
I've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!
Your task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /workspace directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.
Follow these steps to resolve the issue:
1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.
2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error
3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue
4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!
5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well
Your thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.

--------------------- END OF NEW TASK DESCRIPTION ---------------------

PLEASE follow the format strictly! PLEASE EMIT ONE AND ONLY ONE FUNCTION CALL PER MESSAGE.

================================================================================
RESPONSE:
Based on the repository structure, I can see this is the Django source code. The issue appears to be related to the admin interface and UUID fields, so I'll need to focus on the relevant admin-related files.

Let me first check the admin-related files to understand where the UUID handling might be implemented:

<function=execute_bash>
<parameter=command>find /workspace/django__django__5.0/django/contrib/admin -name "*.py"</parameter>

RESPONSE:
The key files related to admin functionality appear to be in the admin directory. The issue seems to be related to UUID field handling in inlines, so I'll need to examine the options.py file which contains the ModelAdmin and InlineModelAdmin classes.

Let me view the contents of the options.py file to understand how inlines are handled:

<function=str_replace_editor>
<parameter=command>view</parameter>
<parameter=path>/workspace/django__django__5.0/django/contrib/admin/options.py</parameter>

RESPONSE:
Let me narrow down the search to look specifically for UUID-related handling in the admin options. I'll search for "UUID" in the options.py file:

<function=execute_bash>
<parameter=command>grep -n UUID /workspace/django__django__5.0/django/contrib/admin/options.py</parameter>

[Command finished with exit code 0]

================================================================================
RESPONSE:
The only reference to UUID in the options.py file is in the FORMFIELD_FOR_DBFIELD_DEFAULTS dictionary, which specifies the widget to use for UUID fields. This suggests that the issue might be related to how UUID fields are handled during form processing, particularly in inline formsets.

Let me check the forms.py file in the admin directory to see how inline formsets are handled:

This file only contains authentication-related forms. Since the issue is related to inline formsets and UUID fields, I need to look elsewhere. Let me check the inline.py file in the forms directory:

It seems there is no inline.py file in the forms directory. Let me instead check the inline formset implementation in the forms/models.py file:

RESPONSE:
Let me search specifically for UUID-related handling in the forms/models.py file:

<function=execute_bash>
<parameter=command>grep -n UUID /workspace/django__django__5.0/django/forms/models.py</parameter>

RESPONSE:
There are no direct references to UUID in the forms/models.py file. This suggests that the issue might be related to how Django handles default values in general, rather than being specific to UUID fields.

Let me check the model field implementation for UUID fields in the db/models/fields directory:

<function=execute_bash>
<parameter=command>find /workspace/django__django__5.0/django/db/models/fields -name "*.py"</parameter>

Let me check the __init__.py file in the fields directory, as it likely contains the UUIDField implementation:

================================================================================
RESPONSE:
The UUIDField implementation shows that it handles UUID values and their conversion between Python and database formats. The key parts are:

1. It inherits from Field and sets empty_strings_allowed = False
2. It has specific methods for handling UUID conversion (to_python, get_db_prep_value)
3. It uses forms.UUIDField for form representation

The issue in the PR description appears to be related to how default values are handled in inline forms. Since the UUIDField implementation looks correct, the problem might be in how Django handles default values during inline form processing.

Let me check how default values are handled in the BaseInlineFormSet implementation:

================================================================================
RESPONSE:
The BaseInlineFormSet implementation shows how inline forms are handled, particularly around foreign key relationships. The key parts relevant to our issue are:

1. The _construct_form method (lines 1118-1139) handles setting foreign key values
2. The add_fields method (lines 1152-1183) adds the foreign key field to the form
3. The save_new method (lines 1145-1150) handles saving new instances

The issue appears to be that when adding a new inline instance, the UUID default value isn't being properly set. This might be because the form processing is not respecting the default value for UUID fields during inline form submission.

Let me check how default values are handled in the form processing logic. I'll look at the save_new method more closely:

RESPONSE:
The save_new method shows that it sets the foreign key relationship but doesn't handle default values for other fields. This suggests that the issue might be in how the form instance is created and initialized before saving.

The BaseModelFormSet's save_new method simply calls form.save(), which means the handling of default values would be in the form's save method. Since we're dealing with UUID fields, we need to see how the form handles default values during saving.

================================================================================
RESPONSE:
The ModelForm's save method shows that it simply calls instance.save() when committing. This suggests that the handling of default values would be in the model's save method or field's pre_save/post_save hooks.

Since we're dealing with UUID fields, let's check how default values are handled in the model's save method. I'll need to see the model implementation from the user's example.

Based on the PR description, the models are:

```python
class UUIDModel(models.Model):
    pkid = models.BigAutoField(primary_key=True, editable=False)
    id = models.UUIDField(default=uuid.uuid4, editable=False, unique=True)
    class Meta:
        abstract = True

class Thing(UUIDModel):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=191)

class SubThing(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=191)
    thing = models.ForeignKey(
        'bugapp.Thing',
        to_field='id',
        on_delete = models.CASCADE,
        related_name='subthings',
    )
```

The issue occurs when adding a SubThing inline to a Thing in the admin. The UUID default value for Thing.id is not being set properly.

This suggests we need to modify how the admin handles default values for inlines. Let me check the admin's handling of default values in the options.py file:

<function=execute_bash>
<parameter=command>grep -n default /workspace/django__django__5.0/django/contrib/admin/options.py</parameter>

================================================================================
RESPONSE:
The search results show various places where defaults are handled in the admin, but none directly related to field default values. This suggests we need to modify how the admin handles default values for fields in inline formsets.

The issue appears to be that when creating a new inline instance, the UUID default value isn't being properly set before validation. We should modify the BaseInlineFormSet's _construct_form method to ensure default values are set.

Let me propose a fix by modifying the BaseInlineFormSet implementation. First, I'll need to create a custom InlineFormSet that properly handles default values:

        form = super()._construct_form(i, **kwargs)
        
        # Set default values for fields with defaults
        for field in self.model._meta.fields:
            if field.has_default() and not hasattr(form.instance, field.attname):
                setattr(form.instance, field.attname, field.get_default())

================================================================================
RESPONSE:
Now that we have the test file, let's run the tests to verify the fix:

<function=execute_bash>
<parameter=command>cd /workspace/django__django__5.0 && python manage.py test django.contrib.admin.tests.test_uuid_inlines</parameter>

================================================================================
RESPONSE:
It seems we need to set up a Django project to run the tests properly. Let me create a minimal Django project structure:

<function=execute_bash>
<parameter=command>
cd /workspace/django__django__5.0 && 
django-admin startproject testproject && 
cd testproject && 
python manage.py startapp bugapp
</parameter>

LAST RESPONSE:
Now that we have a test project set up, let's move our custom admin code and models to the bugapp:

1. First, move the models:

<function=str_replace_editor>
<parameter=command>create</parameter>
<parameter=path>/workspace/django__django__5.0/testproject/bugapp/models.py</parameter>
<parameter=file_text>
import uuid
from django.db import models

class UUIDModel(models.Model):
    pkid = models.BigAutoField(primary_key=True, editable=False)
    id = models.UUIDField(default=uuid.uuid4, editable=False, unique=True)
    class Meta:
        abstract = True

class Thing(UUIDModel):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=191)

class SubThing(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=191)
    thing = models.ForeignKey(
        Thing,
        to_field='id',
        on_delete=models.CASCADE,
        related_name='subthings',
    )
</parameter>
