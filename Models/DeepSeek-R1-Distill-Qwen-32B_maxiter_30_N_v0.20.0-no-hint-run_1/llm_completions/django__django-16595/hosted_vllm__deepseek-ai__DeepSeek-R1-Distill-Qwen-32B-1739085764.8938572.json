The goal is to modify Django's migration optimizer to properly reduce consecutive `AlterField` operations into a single operation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how Django's migration optimizer works. The optimizer is located in `django/db/migrations/optimizer.py` and its main job is to simplify the list of migration operations by merging or removing redundant operations.\n\nLooking at the issue description, the problem occurs when there are multiple `AlterField` operations on the same field. The current optimizer doesn't reduce these into a single operation, which can lead to unnecessary migration steps.\n\nTo fix this, I'll need to modify the `AlterField` operation class to implement a `reduce` method that can merge consecutive `AlterField` operations affecting the same field.\n\nHere's my plan:\n1. First, I'll explore the repository structure to locate the relevant files.\n2. Then, I'll create a test script to reproduce the issue.\n3. Next, I'll modify the `AlterField` class to implement the `reduce` method.\n4. Finally, I'll test the changes to ensure the issue is resolved.\n\nLet's start by exploring the repository structure.\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<function=execute_bash>\n<parameter=command>\nls -R /workspace/django__django__5.0/django/db/migrations/\n</parameter>\n", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "refusal": null, "reasoning_content": "\nOkay, I need to help the user fix the issue where the migration optimizer doesn't reduce multiple AlterField operations. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe user provided a scenario where multiple AlterField operations are not being optimized. The current optimizer only reduces AddField operations but not AlterField ones. The goal is to modify the optimizer so that consecutive AlterField operations on the same field are reduced into a single operation.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the existing code structure. The repository is in /workspace/django__django__5.0. I remember that Django's migration optimizer is located in the django/db/migrations/optimizer.py file. The relevant class is the MigrationOptimizer, which has a method called optimize that processes the operations.\n\nI need to find where the reduction of operations happens. In the optimize method, there's a loop that iterates through each operation and tries to reduce it with the previous one. The reduce method is called on the previous operation, passing the current one.\n\nLooking at the AlterField class in django/db/migrations/operations.py, I see that it doesn't currently implement the reduce method. That's why the optimizer isn't combining them. So, the plan is to add a reduce method to AlterField that checks if the current operation can be merged with the previous one.\n\nWhat conditions should be met for two AlterField operations to be merged? They must be altering the same field in the same model. So, I'll need to check if the model_name, name, and field are the same. Wait, actually, since each AlterField is changing the same field, the field definitions might be different, but we can merge them into the last one.\n\nSo, in the reduce method, if the other operation is also an AlterField and affects the same model and field, we return the other operation as the reduced form. This way, only the last AlterField is kept, and the previous ones are discarded.\n\nI'll modify the AlterField class by adding the reduce method. This method will check if the other operation is an instance of AlterField and if the model_name, name, and field are the same. If so, it returns the other operation, effectively merging them.\n\nAfter making this change, I need to test it. The user provided a script that reproduces the issue. I'll run that script to see if the optimizer now correctly reduces the AlterField operations.\n\nI should also consider edge cases. For example, what if there are multiple AlterField operations interspersed with other operations? The optimizer should only merge consecutive AlterField operations. Also, if an AlterField is followed by a different type of operation, it shouldn't be merged.\n\nAnother consideration is ensuring that the reduce method doesn't cause any unintended side effects. For instance, if the field definitions are different in a way that can't be merged, the optimizer should leave them as separate operations. But in the given issue, the user wants to merge them, so the current approach should suffice.\n\nI think that's the main change needed. Now, I'll proceed to implement this by editing the AlterField class in the operations.py file.\n"}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 933, "prompt_tokens": 3588, "total_tokens": 4521, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}, "args": [], "kwargs": {"stop": ["</function"], "tool_choice": "none"}, "timestamp": 1739085764.8938663, "cost": 0, "fncall_messages": [{"content": "You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.\n<IMPORTANT>\n* If user provides a path, you should NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory.
