So when you try and check lookups for restaurant__place__country it thinks 'place' is the concrete parent of 'restaurant' and shortcuts it to restaurant__country which isn't in 'list_filter'. And you can't add restaurant__country to list_filter because country isn't actually on restaurant.\n\n</issue_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <issue_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>.

AFTER REASONING, EMIT ONE AND ONLY ONE FUNCTION CALL PER MESSAGE.\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<|begin_of_thought|>\nAlright, let's tackle this issue step by step. The problem is that Django's ModelAdmin.lookup_allowed() method is incorrectly raising a DisallowedModelAdminLookup error when dealing with foreign keys that are used as primary keys. This is causing valid lookups to be blocked, which shouldn't happen.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the Django repository in the provided workspace. From the uploaded files, I can see there's a directory named `django__django__5.0`, which likely contains the Django source code. My goal is to find where the `lookup_allowed` method is defined and modify it to handle foreign keys correctly.\n\nThe `lookup_allowed` method is part of Django's ModelAdmin class, which is located in `django/contrib/admin/options.py`. This method is responsible for checking whether a given lookup is allowed in the admin interface. The issue arises because the current implementation incorrectly treats foreign keys as primary keys in certain cases, leading to the DisallowedModelAdminLookup error.\n\nTo reproduce the error, I'll create a test script that sets up the models and admin as described in the issue. This script will attempt to perform the lookup that's failing and should raise the error if the issue isn't fixed.\n\nOnce I've confirmed the error, I'll move on to modifying the source code. The key is to adjust the logic in `lookup_allowed` so that it correctly handles cases where a foreign key is used as a primary key. Specifically, I need to ensure that the method doesn't shortcut the lookup when traversing through foreign keys that are primary keys.\n\nI'll make the necessary changes to the `lookup_allowed` method, ensuring that it properly follows the relationships without incorrectly assuming a concrete parent model. After making these changes, I'll rerun the test script to confirm that the error is resolved.\n\nFinally, I'll consider any edge cases that might be affected by this change, such as deeper nested lookups or other types of relational fields, to ensure that the fix is comprehensive and doesn't introduce new issues.\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\nLet's start by exploring the repository structure and identifying the relevant files.\n\n<function=execute_bash>\n<parameter=command>ls -R /workspace/django__django__5.0 | grep -E 'options.py$'</parameter>\n</function>"}, {"role": "user", "content": "EXECUTION RESULT of [execute_bash]:\noptions.py\noptions.py\noptions.py\n[The command completed with exit code 0.]\n[Current working directory: /workspace/django__django__5.0]\n[Python interpreter: /opt/miniconda3/envs/testbed/bin/python]\n[Command finished with exit code 0]"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<function=str_replace_editor>\n<parameter=command>view</parameter>\n<parameter=path>/workspace/django__django__5.0/django/contrib/admin/options.py</parameter>\n</function>"}, {"role": "user", "content": "EXECUTION RESULT of [str_replace_editor]:\nHere's the result of running `cat -n` on /workspace/django__django__5.0/django/contrib/admin/options.py:\n     1\timport copy\n     2\timport enum\n     3\timport json\n     4\timport re\n     5\tfrom functools import partial, update_wrapper\n     6\tfrom urllib.parse import quote as urlquote\n     7\t\n     8\tfrom django import forms\n     9\tfrom django.conf import settings\n    10\tfrom django.contrib import messages\n    11\tfrom django.contrib.admin import helpers, widgets\n    12\tfrom django.contrib.admin.checks import (\n    13\t    BaseModelAdminChecks,\n    14\t    InlineModelAdminChecks,\n    15\t    ModelAdminChecks,\n    16\t)\n    17\tfrom django.contrib.admin.exceptions import DisallowedModelAdminToField\n    18\tfrom django.contrib.admin.templatetags.admin_urls import add_preserved_filters\n    19\tfrom django.contrib.admin.utils import (\n    20\t    NestedObjects,\n    21\t    construct_change_message,\n    22\t    flatten_fieldsets,\n    23\t    get_deleted_objects,\n    24\t    lookup_spawns_duplicates,\n    25\t    model_format_dict,\n    26\t    model_ngettext,\n    27\t    quote,\n    28\t    unquote,\n    29\t)\n    30\tfrom django.contrib.admin.widgets import AutocompleteSelect, AutocompleteSelectMultiple\n    31\tfrom django.contrib.auth import get_permission_codename\n    32\tfrom django.core.exceptions import (\n    33\t    FieldDoesNotExist,\n    34\t    FieldError,\n    35\t    PermissionDenied,\n    36\t    ValidationError,\n    37\t)\n    38\tfrom django.core.paginator import Paginator\n    39\tfrom django.db import models, router, transaction\n    40\tfrom django.db.models.constants import LOOKUP_SEP\n    41\tfrom django.forms.formsets import DELETION_FIELD_NAME, all_valid\n    42\tfrom django.forms.models import (\n    43\t    BaseInlineFormSet,\n    44\t    inlineformset_factory,\n    45\t    modelform_defines_fields,\n    46\t    modelform_factory,\n    47\t    modelformset_factory,\n    48\t)\n    49\tfrom django.forms.widgets import CheckboxSelectMultiple, SelectMultiple\n    50\tfrom django.http import HttpResponseRedirect\n    51\tfrom django.http.response import HttpResponseBase\n    52\tfrom django.template.response import SimpleTemplateResponse, TemplateResponse\n    53\tfrom django.urls import reverse\n    54\tfrom django.utils.decorators import method_decorator\n    55\tfrom django.utils.html import format_html\n    56\tfrom django.utils.http import urlencode\n    57\tfrom django.utils.safestring import mark_safe\n    58\tfrom django.utils.text import (\n    59\t    capfirst,\n    60\t    format_lazy,\n    61\t    get_text_list,\n    62\t    smart_split,\n    63\t    unescape_string_literal,\n    64\t)\n    65\tfrom django.utils.translation import gettext as _\n    66\tfrom django.utils.translation import ngettext\n    67\tfrom django.views.decorators.csrf import csrf_protect\n    68\tfrom django.views.generic import RedirectView\n    69\t\n    70\tIS_POPUP_VAR = \"_popup\"\n    71\tTO_FIELD_VAR = \"_to_field\"\n    72\tIS_FACETS_VAR = \"_facets\"\n    73\t\n    74\t\n    75\tclass ShowFacets(enum.Enum):\n    76\t    NEVER = \"NEVER\"\n    77\t    ALLOW = \"ALLOW\"\n    78\t    ALWAYS = \"ALWAYS\"\n    79\t\n    80\t\n    81\tHORIZONTAL, VERTICAL = 1, 2\n    82\t\n    83\t\n    84\tdef get_content_type_for_model(obj):\n    85\t    #

The user provided a detailed problem description and some test code that's failing. My task is to modify the Django source code to resolve this issue.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem thoroughly. The issue arises when a foreign key is used as a primary key in a model, and the admin interface incorrectly blocks certain lookups. The test case provided demonstrates that a lookup like 'restaurant__place__country' is being disallowed, even though it should be allowed.\n\nI remember that in Django, the lookup_allowed method in ModelAdmin is responsible for checking whether a given lookup is allowed. The current implementation might be treating foreign keys as primary keys in a way that's causing the issue. So, I need to adjust this method to correctly handle cases where a foreign key is a primary key.\n\nLooking at the code, the lookup_allowed method is part of the ModelAdmin class in the options.py file. The method checks if a field is a foreign key or a many-to-many field and then verifies if the related model is registered in the admin site and if the field is listed in list_filter. If not, it returns False, disallowing the lookup.\n\nThe problem seems to be that when a foreign key is a primary key, the method is incorrectly assuming that the field shouldn't be allowed unless it's explicitly listed in list_filter. However, in cases where the foreign key is a primary key, the lookup should be allowed even if it's not in list_filter because it's a direct reference.\n\nSo, the plan is to modify the lookup_allowed method to check if the field is a primary key. If it is, the method should allow the lookup without requiring it to be in list_filter.\n\nI'll start by locating the exact code of the lookup_allowed method in the options.py file. Once I have that, I'll adjust the logic to include a check for whether the field is a primary key. If it is, the method will return True, allowing the lookup.\n\nI'll proceed step by step:\n\n1. **Locate the lookup_allowed method**: I need to find where this method is defined in the options.py file. It's part of the ModelAdmin class.\n\n2. **Understand the current logic**: The method checks if the field is a foreign key or many-to-many field, then checks if the related model is registered and if the field is in list_filter.\n\n3. **Modify the logic**: Add a condition to check if the field is a primary key. If it is, allow the lookup without requiring it to be in list_filter.\n\n4. **Test the changes**: After making the changes, I'll run the provided test script to ensure the issue is resolved.\n\nI need to be careful with how I modify the code to ensure that it doesn't introduce new issues. Testing is crucial here to confirm that the fix works as intended and doesn't break other functionalities.\n\nNow, I'll attempt to write the modified lookup_allowed method with the necessary changes.\n"}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1253, "prompt_tokens": 16653, "total_tokens": 17906, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}, "args": [], "kwargs": {"stop": ["</function"], "tool_choice": "none"}, "timestamp": 1739086566.0006824, "cost": 0, "fncall_messages": [{"content": "You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.\n<IMPORTANT>\n* If user provides a path, you should NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory.

So when you try and check lookups for restaurant__place__country it thinks 'place' is the concrete parent of 'restaurant' and shortcuts it to restaurant__country which isn't in 'list_filter'. And you can't add restaurant__country to list_filter because country isn't actually on restaurant.\n\n</issue_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <issue_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>.

The problem is that Django's ModelAdmin.lookup_allowed() method is incorrectly raising a DisallowedModelAdminLookup error when dealing with foreign keys that are used as primary keys.

My goal is to find where the `lookup_allowed` method is defined and modify it to handle foreign keys correctly.\n\nThe `lookup_allowed` method is part of Django's ModelAdmin class, which is located in `django/contrib/admin/options.py`. This method is responsible for checking whether a given lookup is allowed in the admin interface. The issue arises because the current implementation incorrectly treats foreign keys as primary keys in certain cases, leading to the DisallowedModelAdminLookup error.\n\nTo reproduce the error, I'll create a test script that sets up the models and admin as described in the issue. This script will attempt to perform the lookup that's failing and should raise the error if the issue isn't fixed.\n\nOnce I've confirmed the error, I'll move on to modifying the source code. The key is to adjust the logic in `lookup_allowed` so that it correctly handles cases where a foreign key is used as a primary key. Specifically, I need to ensure that the method doesn't shortcut the lookup when traversing through foreign keys that are primary keys.\n\nI'll make the necessary changes to the `lookup_allowed` method, ensuring that it properly follows the relationships without incorrectly assuming a concrete parent model. After making these changes, I'll rerun the test script to confirm that the error is resolved.\n\nFinally, I'll consider any edge cases that might be affected by this change, such as deeper nested lookups or other types of relational fields, to ensure that the fix is comprehensive and doesn't introduce new issues.\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\nLet's start by exploring the repository structure and identifying the relevant files.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"id": "toolu_01", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "execute_bash", "arguments": "{\"command\": \"ls -R /workspace/django__django__5.0 | grep -E 'options.py$'\"}"}}]}, {"content": "options.py\noptions.py\noptions.py\n[The command completed with exit code 0.]\n[Current working directory: /workspace/django__django__5.0]\n[Python interpreter: /opt/miniconda3/envs/testbed/bin/python]\n[Command finished with exit code 0]", "role": "tool", "tool_call_id": "toolu_01", "name": "execute_bash"}, {"content": "", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"id": "toolu_02", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "str_replace_editor", "arguments": "{\"command\": \"view\", \"path\": \"/workspace/django__django__5.0/django/contrib/admin/options.py\"}"}}]}, {"content": "Here's the result of running `cat -n` on /workspace/django__django__5.0/django/contrib/admin/options.py:\n     1\timport copy\n     2\timport enum\n     3\timport json\n     4\timport re\n     5\tfrom functools import partial, update_wrapper\n     6\tfrom urllib.parse import quote as urlquote\n     7\t\n     8\tfrom django import forms\n     9\tfrom django.conf import settings\n    10\tfrom django.contrib import messages\n    11\tfrom django.contrib.admin import helpers, widgets\n    12\tfrom django.contrib.admin.checks import (\n    13\t    BaseModelAdminChecks,\n    14\t    InlineModelAdminChecks,\n    15\t    ModelAdminChecks,\n    16\t)\n    17\tfrom django.contrib.admin.exceptions import DisallowedModelAdminToField\n    18\tfrom django.contrib.admin.templatetags.admin_urls import add_preserved_filters\n    19\tfrom django.contrib.admin.utils import (\n    20\t    NestedObjects,\n    21\t    construct_change_message,\n    22\t    flatten_fieldsets,\n    23\t    get_deleted_objects,\n    24\t    lookup_spawns_duplicates,\n    25\t    model_format_dict,\n    26\t    model_ngettext,\n    27\t    quote,\n    28\t    unquote,\n    29\t)\n    30\tfrom django.contrib.admin.widgets import AutocompleteSelect, AutocompleteSelectMultiple\n    31\tfrom django.contrib.auth import get_permission_codename\n    32\tfrom django.core.exceptions import (\n    33\t    FieldDoesNotExist,\n    34\t    FieldError,\n    35\t    PermissionDenied,\n    36\t    ValidationError,\n    37\t)\n    38\tfrom django.core.paginator import Paginator\n    39\tfrom django.db import models, router, transaction\n    40\tfrom django.db.models.constants import LOOKUP_SEP\n    41\tfrom django.forms.formsets import DELETION_FIELD_NAME, all_valid\n    42\tfrom django.forms.models import (\n    43\t    BaseInlineFormSet,\n    44\t    inlineformset_factory,\n    45\t    modelform_defines_fields,\n    46\t    modelform_factory,\n    47\t    modelformset_factory,\n    48\t)\n    49\tfrom django.forms.widgets import CheckboxSelectMultiple, SelectMultiple\n    50\tfrom django.http import HttpResponseRedirect\n    51\tfrom django.http.response import HttpResponseBase\n    52\tfrom django.template.response import SimpleTemplateResponse, TemplateResponse\n    53\tfrom django.urls import reverse\n    54\tfrom django.utils.decorators import method_decorator\n    55\tfrom django.utils.html import format_html\n    56\tfrom django.utils.http import urlencode\n    57\tfrom django.utils.safestring import mark_safe\n    58\tfrom django.utils.text import (\n    59\t    capfirst,\n    60\t    format_lazy,\n    61\t    get_text_list,\n    62\t    smart_split,\n    63\t    unescape_string_literal,\n    64\t)\n    65\tfrom django.utils.translation import gettext as _\n    66\tfrom django.utils.translation import ngettext\n    67\tfrom django.views.decorators.csrf import csrf_protect\n    68\tfrom django.views.generic import RedirectView\n    69\t\n    70\tIS_POPUP_VAR = \"_popup\"\n    71\tTO_FIELD_VAR = \"_to_field\"\n    72\tIS_FACETS_VAR = \"_facets\"\n    73\t\n    74\t\n    75\tclass ShowFacets(enum.Enum):\n    76\t    NEVER = \"NEVER\"\n    77\t    ALLOW = \"ALLOW\"\n    78\t    ALWAYS = \"ALWAYS\"\n    79\t\n    80\t\n    81\tHORIZONTAL, VERTICAL = 1, 2\n    82\t\n    83\t\n    84\tdef get_content_type_for_model(obj):\n    85\t    #
