By setting `is_input` to `true`, the assistant can interact with the running process and send empty `command` to retrieve any additional logs, or send additional text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process, or send command like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process.\n* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty string to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the currently running process. Note: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n  (2) is_input (string, optional): If True, the command is an input to the running process.

If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n\nNotes for using the `str_replace` command:\n* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!\n* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique\n* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run.

The user is experiencing a rendering problem with Sphinx documentation when combining multiple parameters in a docstring.

Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe user's team is using a docstring format where multiple parameters are listed on the same line, like `x1, x2 : array_like`. According to the numpydoc guide, this should be possible, but when they do this, the rendered HTML doesn't display correctly. Additionally, when they add \"optional\" to the parameter types, it doesn't show up in the output, making it unclear whether the parameters are optional.\n\nThe expected behavior is that each parameter should be listed with their type and whether they're optional, all properly formatted in the HTML output. The user provided an example of how it should look, with each parameter and its details clearly shown.\n\nFirst, I need to explore the repository structure. The user mentioned that the code is in the directory `sphinx-doc__sphinx__3.2`. I'll use the `str_replace_editor` function to view the contents of this directory. This will help me understand where the relevant files are located, such as the source code and configuration files.\n\nOnce I have the structure, I'll look for the file that contains the function with the problematic docstring. Let's assume it's in a file like `sphinx-doc__sphinx__3.2/sphinx/ext/napoleon.py` or another relevant extension file. The issue might be in how the Napoleon extension parses the docstrings and generates the HTML.\n\nNext, I'll create a minimal example script to reproduce the error. This script will define a function with the problematic docstring and use Sphinx to generate the documentation. By running this script, I can confirm that the issue exists and understand how it's being triggered.\n\nAfter setting up the reproduction script, I'll run it using the `execute_bash` function. If the error occurs as expected, I'll proceed to the next step.\n\nNow, I need to edit the source code to fix the issue. The problem likely lies in how the parameter lines are parsed and displayed. The current implementation might not correctly handle multiple parameters on the same line, especially when additional qualifiers like \"optional\" are present.\n\nI'll look into the Napoleon extension's code, specifically the part that processes the parameter sections. The goal is to modify the parsing logic so that each parameter is correctly identified, including their types and any additional qualifiers. This might involve splitting the parameter line into individual parameters and ensuring that each is displayed correctly in the HTML output.\n\nI'll make the necessary changes to the code, ensuring that the fix handles both single and multiple parameters on the same line, as well as any additional descriptors like \"optional\".\n\nAfter making the changes, I'll rerun the reproduction script to test if the issue is resolved. The rendered HTML should now display each parameter correctly, with their types and any additional qualifiers visible.\n\nFinally, I'll consider any edge cases, such as parameters with different types or additional descriptors, to ensure that the fix is robust and handles all scenarios properly.\n"}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1041, "prompt_tokens": 3701, "total_tokens": 4742, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}, "args": [], "kwargs": {"stop": ["</function"], "tool_choice": "none"}, "timestamp": 1739091679.9846218, "cost": 0, "fncall_messages": [{"content": "You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.\n<IMPORTANT>\n* If user provides a path, you should NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory.
