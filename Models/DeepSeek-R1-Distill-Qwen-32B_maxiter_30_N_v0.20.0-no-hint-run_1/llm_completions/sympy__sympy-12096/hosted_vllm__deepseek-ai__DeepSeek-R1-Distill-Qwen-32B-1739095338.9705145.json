AFTER REASONING, EMIT ONE AND ONLY ONE FUNCTION CALL PER MESSAGE.\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<|begin_of_thought|>\nAlright, let's tackle this issue step by step. The problem is that `evalf` isn't recursively calling `_imp_` for implemented functions, which means nested function calls aren't being evaluated properly.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the SymPy repository. From the uploaded files, I can see the main directory is `sympy__sympy__1.0`. I'll start by exploring this directory to locate the relevant files.\n\nI recall that implemented functions in SymPy are handled in the `sympy.utilities.lambdify` module, but the core function evaluation logic is in `sympy.core.function`. Specifically, the `_eval_evalf` method in the `Function` class is where the `evalf` functionality is defined.\n\nLet me verify this by checking the code structure:\n1. The main SymPy code is in `sympy/core/function.py`\n2. Implemented functions are defined in `sympy/utilities/lambdify.py`\n\nNext, I'll create a test script to reproduce the issue. This will help confirm that the problem exists and will serve as a way to verify our fix.\n\nAfter setting up the test, I'll analyze the current implementation of `_eval_evalf`. From the issue description, it seems that after calling `_imp_`, the result isn't being passed through `evalf` again, which means any nested SymPy expressions won't be evaluated numerically.\n\nThe solution should involve modifying `_eval_evalf` to recursively call `evalf` on the result of `_imp_`. This way, even if the implemented function returns another SymPy expression, it will be fully evaluated.\n\nI'll proceed with the following steps:\n1. Create a test script in the repository\n2. Run the test to confirm the issue\n3. Modify `function.py` to fix the evaluation logic\n4. Run the test again to verify the fix\n5. Consider edge cases like nested implemented functions and ensure they're handled correctly\n\nLet's start by creating the test script.\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\nFirst, I'll create a test script to reproduce the issue:\n\n<function=str_replace_editor>\n<parameter=command>create</parameter>\n<parameter=path>/workspace/sympy__sympy__1.0/test_evalf.py</parameter>\n<parameter=file_text>\nfrom sympy.utilities.lambdify import implemented_function\nfrom sympy import Symbol\n\ndef test_evalf():\n    f = implemented_function('f', lambda x: x ** 2)\n    g = implemented_function('g', lambda x: 2 * x)\n    \n    x = Symbol('x')\n    \n    # Test individual evaluations\n    assert f(2).evalf() == 4.0\n    assert g(2).evalf() == 4.0\n    \n    # Test nested evaluation\n    result = f(g(2)).evalf()\n    assert result == 16.0, f\"Expected 16.0, got {result}\"\n    \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    test_evalf()\n</parameter>\n</function>"}, {"role": "user", "content": "EXECUTION RESULT of [str_replace_editor]:\nFile created successfully at: /workspace/sympy__sympy__1.0/test_evalf.py"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let me run the test script to confirm the issue:\n\n<function=execute_bash>\n<parameter=command>python3 /workspace/sympy__sympy__1.0/test_evalf.py</parameter>\n</function>"}, {"role": "user", "content": "EXECUTION RESULT of [execute_bash]:\n/workspace/sympy__sympy__1.0/sympy/core/basic.py:3: DeprecationWarning: Using or importing the ABCs from 'collections' instead of from 'collections.abc' is deprecated since Python 3.3, and in 3.10 it will stop working\n  from collections import Mapping\n/workspace/sympy__sympy__1.0/sympy/solvers/diophantine.py:3188: SyntaxWarning: \"is\" with a literal.

From the problem description, when you have two implemented functions, like `f` and `g`, and you try to evaluate `f(g(2))`, it doesn't work as expected. Instead of computing the nested functions, it just returns the expression as a string.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how `evalf` works in SymPy. I know that `evalf` is used to evaluate expressions numerically. For implemented functions, which are defined using `sympy.utilities.lambdify.implemented_function`, the evaluation should call the provided lambda function. However, in the case of nested functions, it seems that `evalf` isn't recursively applying itself to the result of the inner function.\n\nLooking at the code, the `_eval_evalf` method in the `Function` class is responsible for evaluating the function numerically. The current implementation checks if there's an implemented function (`_imp_`) and calls it with the arguments. But it doesn't check if the result is another SymPy expression that needs further evaluation.\n\nSo, the plan is to modify the `_eval_evalf` method to check if the result of the implemented function is a SymPy `Basic` object. If it is, we recursively call `evalf` on it. This way, any nested SymPy expressions will be evaluated properly.\n\nI'll start by locating the `_eval_evalf` method in the `sympy/core/function.py` file. Once found, I'll update it to include the recursive check. Here's the current code:\n\n```python\ndef _eval_evalf(self, prec):\n    if self._imp_ is not None:\n        return self._imp_(*self.args)\n    return None\n```\n\nAnd here's the updated version:\n\n```python\ndef _eval_evalf(self, prec):\n    if self._imp_ is not None:\n        result = self._imp_(*self.args)\n        if isinstance(result, Basic):\n            return result.evalf()\n        return result\n    return None\n```\n\nThis change ensures that if the implemented function returns another SymPy expression, it will be evaluated numerically.\n\nNext, I'll test this change using the provided test script. The test script defines two implemented functions, `f` and `g`, and checks if `f(g(2))` evaluates correctly. If the fix works, the nested evaluation should return `16.0` instead of the string representation of the expression.\n\nI'll run the test script again after applying the change. If the test passes, it means the issue is resolved. If not, I'll need to debug further, possibly checking for other edge cases or issues in the implementation.\n\nIn summary, the key steps are:\n1. Identify the `_eval_evalf` method in `function.py`.\n2. Modify it to check and recursively evaluate the result if it's a SymPy expression.\n3. Test the change to ensure it fixes the nested evaluation issue.\n\nBy following these steps, I should be able to resolve the problem where `evalf` doesn't handle nested implemented functions correctly.\n"}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 937, "prompt_tokens": 14709, "total_tokens": 15646, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}, "args": [], "kwargs": {"stop": ["</function"], "tool_choice": "none"}, "timestamp": 1739095338.9705243, "cost": 0, "fncall_messages": [{"content": "You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.\n<IMPORTANT>\n* If user provides a path, you should NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory.

This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /workspace directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.\nPlease structure your response using the format specified in the system prompt above, with clear <|begin_of_thought|> and <|begin_of_solution|> sections.\n", "role": "user"}, {"content": "<|begin_of_thought|>\nAlright, let's tackle this issue step by step. The problem is that `evalf` isn't recursively calling `_imp_` for implemented functions, which means nested function calls aren't being evaluated properly.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the SymPy repository. From the uploaded files, I can see the main directory is `sympy__sympy__1.0`. I'll start by exploring this directory to locate the relevant files.\n\nI recall that implemented functions in SymPy are handled in the `sympy.utilities.lambdify` module, but the core function evaluation logic is in `sympy.core.function`. Specifically, the `_eval_evalf` method in the `Function` class is where the `evalf` functionality is defined.\n\nLet me verify this by checking the code structure:\n1. The main SymPy code is in `sympy/core/function.py`\n2. Implemented functions are defined in `sympy/utilities/lambdify.py`\n\nNext, I'll create a test script to reproduce the issue. This will help confirm that the problem exists and will serve as a way to verify our fix.\n\nAfter setting up the test, I'll analyze the current implementation of `_eval_evalf`. From the issue description, it seems that after calling `_imp_`, the result isn't being passed through `evalf` again, which means any nested SymPy expressions won't be evaluated numerically.\n\nThe solution should involve modifying `_eval_evalf` to recursively call `evalf` on the result of `_imp_`. This way, even if the implemented function returns another SymPy expression, it will be fully evaluated.\n\nI'll proceed with the following steps:\n1. Create a test script in the repository\n2. Run the test to confirm the issue\n3. Modify `function.py` to fix the evaluation logic\n4. Run the test again to verify the fix\n5. Consider edge cases like nested implemented functions and ensure they're handled correctly\n\nLet's start by creating the test script.\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\nFirst, I'll create a test script to reproduce the issue:", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"id": "toolu_01", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "str_replace_editor", "arguments": "{\"command\": \"create\", \"path\": \"/workspace/sympy__sympy__1.0/test_evalf.py\", \"file_text\": \"from sympy.utilities.lambdify import implemented_function\\nfrom sympy import Symbol\\n\\ndef test_evalf():\\n    f = implemented_function('f', lambda x: x ** 2)\\n    g = implemented_function('g', lambda x: 2 * x)\\n    \\n    x = Symbol('x')\\n    \\n    # Test individual evaluations\\n    assert f(2).evalf() == 4.0\\n    assert g(2).evalf() == 4.0\\n    \\n    # Test nested evaluation\\n    result = f(g(2)).evalf()\\n    assert result == 16.0, f\\\"Expected 16.0, got {result}\\\"\\n    \\nif __name__ == \\\"__main__\\\":\\n    test_evalf()\"}"}}]}, {"content": "File created successfully at: /workspace/sympy__sympy__1.0/test_evalf.py", "role": "tool", "tool_call_id": "toolu_01", "name": "str_replace_editor"}, {"content": "Let me run the test script to confirm the issue:", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"id": "toolu_02", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "execute_bash", "arguments": "{\"command\": \"python3 /workspace/sympy__sympy__1.0/test_evalf.py\"}"}}]}, {"content": "/workspace/sympy__sympy__1.0/sympy/core/basic.py:3: DeprecationWarning: Using or importing the ABCs from 'collections' instead of from 'collections.abc' is deprecated since Python 3.3, and in 3.10 it will stop working\n  from collections import Mapping\n/workspace/sympy__sympy__1.0/sympy/solvers/diophantine.py:3188: SyntaxWarning: \"is\" with a literal.
