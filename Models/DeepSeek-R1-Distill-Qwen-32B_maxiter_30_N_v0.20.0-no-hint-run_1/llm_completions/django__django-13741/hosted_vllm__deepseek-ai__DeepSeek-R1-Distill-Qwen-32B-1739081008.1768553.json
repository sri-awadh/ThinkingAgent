By setting `is_input` to `true`, the assistant can interact with the running process and send empty `command` to retrieve any additional logs, or send additional text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process, or send command like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process.\n* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty string to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the currently running process. Note: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n  (2) is_input (string, optional): If True, the command is an input to the running process. If False, the command is a bash command to be executed in the terminal. Default is False.\nAllowed values: [`true`, `false`]\n---- END FUNCTION #1 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: finish ----\nDescription: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.\nNo parameters are required for this function.\n---- END FUNCTION #2 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----\nDescription: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files in plain-text format\n* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user\n* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n\nNotes for using the `str_replace` command:\n* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!\n* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique\n* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\nAllowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]\n  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/workspace/file.py` or `/workspace`.\n  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\n  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\n  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added).

Consider the following issue description:\n\n<issue_description>\nSet disabled prop on ReadOnlyPasswordHashField\nDescription\n\t\nCurrently the django.contrib.auth.forms.UserChangeForm defines a clean_password method that returns the initial password value to prevent (accidental) changes to the password value. It is also documented that custom forms for the User model need to define this method: \u200bhttps://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/auth/customizing/#a-full-example\nA while ago the forms.Field base class gained the \u200bdisabled argument to:\n[disable] a form field using the disabled HTML attribute so that it won\u2019t be editable by users. Even if a user tampers with the field\u2019s value submitted to the server, it will be ignored in favor of the value from the form\u2019s initial data.\nIt seems to me that this property could be set to True be default on the ReadOnlyPasswordHashField used to display the password hash. This way the clean_password is no longer necessary and the potential pitfall when using the ReadOnlyPasswordHashField without implementing clean_password is removed.\n\n</issue_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <issue_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /workspace directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.\nPlease structure your response using the format specified in the system prompt above, with clear <|begin_of_thought|> and <|begin_of_solution|> sections.\n\n--------------------- END OF NEW TASK DESCRIPTION --------------------- \n\nREASON AS MUCH AS NEEDED, BUT RESPECT THE FORMAT STRICTLY! AFTER REASONING, EMIT ONE AND ONLY ONE FUNCTION CALL PER MESSAGE.\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<|begin_of_thought|>\nAlright, let's tackle this issue step by step. The goal is to modify the ReadOnlyPasswordHashField in Django's UserChangeForm to set the disabled property by default, which will make the password field read-only and eliminate the need for the clean_password method.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the current structure of the Django repository in the /workspace/django__django__3.2 directory. I'll start by listing the contents of this directory to identify where the relevant files are located.\n\nNext, I'll focus on the forms.py file within the django/contrib/auth directory, as this is where the UserChangeForm and ReadOnlyPasswordHashField are defined. My task is to modify the ReadOnlyPasswordHashField to set disabled=True by default.\n\nTo reproduce the issue, I'll create a simple test script that creates a UserChangeForm instance, attempts to modify the password field, and checks if the changes are persisted. Without the fix, the form should allow the password to be changed, but with the fix, it should ignore the changes due to the disabled property.\n\nAfter making the necessary code changes, I'll rerun the test script to ensure the issue is resolved. Additionally, I'll consider edge cases such as:\n1. What happens if a user tries to manually edit the password field despite it being disabled?\n2. Does this change affect any other parts of the application that might rely on the password field being editable?\n3. Are there any scenarios where the disabled property might not work as intended?\n\nBy addressing these considerations, I can ensure that the fix is robust and doesn't introduce new issues.\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\nLet's start by exploring the repository structure to identify the relevant files.\n\n<function=execute_bash>\n<parameter=command>ls

The user wants to set the disabled property so that the password field is read-only, which would eliminate the need for the clean_password method.\n\nFirst, I looked at the repository structure and found the forms.py file where the ReadOnlyPasswordHashField is defined. I viewed the contents of forms.py and identified the ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget and ReadOnlyPasswordHashField classes.\n\nI noticed that the ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget already has a read_only attribute set to True, but it doesn't handle the disabled property. My initial thought was to modify the widget to include the disabled attribute. I tried adding an __init__ method to the widget to set disabled=True by default and then update the get_context method to include this attribute in the widget's attrs.\n\nHowever, when I made those changes, I ended up duplicating the get_context method, which caused issues. I realized that I shouldn't have duplicated the method and instead should have modified the existing one. I tried to correct this by replacing the old get_context method with the updated version, but I encountered an error because the old_str I provided didn't match exactly what was in the file.\n\nI think the problem is that the line numbers I used in the old_str parameter were incorrect, leading to the str_replace function not finding the exact match. I need to ensure that the line numbers and the exact content of the method are correctly specified so that the replacement works as intended.\n\nTo fix this, I should accurately determine the line numbers of the get_context method in the forms.py file. Once I have the correct line numbers, I can provide the exact old_str and new_str parameters to replace the method properly without duplication.\n\nAdditionally, I should verify that the changes I make to the widget correctly set the disabled attribute and that it's applied when the form is rendered. Testing the form after making these changes will help confirm that the password field is indeed disabled and that the clean_password method is no longer necessary.\n\nOverall, the key steps are:\n1. Accurately identify the lines of the get_context method in forms.py.\n2. Modify the ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget to include the disabled attribute.\n3. Update the get_context method to include the disabled attribute in the widget's attrs.\n4. Test the changes to ensure the password field is disabled and the clean_password method is unnecessary.\n\nI need to be careful with the line numbers and ensure that the replacement string exactly matches the current content to avoid errors. Once that's done, the changes should resolve the issue as intended.\n"}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 899, "prompt_tokens": 10824, "total_tokens": 11723, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}, "args": [], "kwargs": {"stop": ["</function"], "tool_choice": "none"}, "timestamp": 1739081008.1768646, "cost": 0, "fncall_messages": [{"content": "You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.\n<IMPORTANT>\n* If user provides a path, you should NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory.

Consider the following issue description:\n\n<issue_description>\nSet disabled prop on ReadOnlyPasswordHashField\nDescription\n\t\nCurrently the django.contrib.auth.forms.UserChangeForm defines a clean_password method that returns the initial password value to prevent (accidental) changes to the password value. It is also documented that custom forms for the User model need to define this method: \u200bhttps://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/auth/customizing/#a-full-example\nA while ago the forms.Field base class gained the \u200bdisabled argument to:\n[disable] a form field using the disabled HTML attribute so that it won\u2019t be editable by users. Even if a user tampers with the field\u2019s value submitted to the server, it will be ignored in favor of the value from the form\u2019s initial data.\nIt seems to me that this property could be set to True be default on the ReadOnlyPasswordHashField used to display the password hash. This way the clean_password is no longer necessary and the potential pitfall when using the ReadOnlyPasswordHashField without implementing clean_password is removed.\n\n</issue_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <issue_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>.

As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5.

The goal is to modify the ReadOnlyPasswordHashField in Django's UserChangeForm to set the disabled property by default, which will make the password field read-only and eliminate the need for the clean_password method.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the current structure of the Django repository in the /workspace/django__django__3.2 directory. I'll start by listing the contents of this directory to identify where the relevant files are located.\n\nNext, I'll focus on the forms.py file within the django/contrib/auth directory, as this is where the UserChangeForm and ReadOnlyPasswordHashField are defined. My task is to modify the ReadOnlyPasswordHashField to set disabled=True by default.\n\nTo reproduce the issue, I'll create a simple test script that creates a UserChangeForm instance, attempts to modify the password field, and checks if the changes are persisted. Without the fix, the form should allow the password to be changed, but with the fix, it should ignore the changes due to the disabled property.\n\nAfter making the necessary code changes, I'll rerun the test script to ensure the issue is resolved. Additionally, I'll consider edge cases such as:\n1. What happens if a user tries to manually edit the password field despite it being disabled?\n2. Does this change affect any other parts of the application that might rely on the password field being editable?\n3. Are there any scenarios where the disabled property might not work as intended?\n\nBy addressing these considerations, I can ensure that the fix is robust and doesn't introduce new
