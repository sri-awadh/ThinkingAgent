By setting `is_input` to `true`, the assistant can interact with the running process and send empty `command` to retrieve any additional logs, or send additional text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process, or send command like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process.\n* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time.

Can be empty string to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the currently running process. Note: You can only execute one bash command at a time.

The problem is that when using unqualified class names in :type: and :rtype: directives, Sphinx is generating ambiguous warnings because it finds multiple possible matches across different modules. The goal is to make these directives behave consistently with explicit :py:class: references, which respect the current module context.\n\nFirst, I'll need to understand how the :type: and :rtype: directives are processed in Sphinx. These directives are part of the Python domain, so I'll focus on the `sphinx/domains/python.py` file.\n\nIn the Python domain, the `PyFunction` class handles parameters and return types. The `type` and `rtype` directives are processed here. The issue likely stems from how these types are resolved. When an unqualified name like `A` is used, it should be resolved relative to the current module, not searched globally across all modules.\n\nLooking at the code, I suspect that the `parse_type` method or similar is not correctly using the current module context. This method probably needs to be adjusted to consider the current module when resolving unqualified type names.\n\nI'll modify the `parse_type` method (or wherever the type resolution happens) to prepend the current module to the type name if it's unqualified. This way, `A` becomes `current_module.A`, preventing the ambiguous lookup.\n\nAfter making these changes, I'll test the fix by running the provided test script. This will ensure that the warnings are resolved and that the correct classes are referenced.\n\nAdditionally, I'll consider edge cases, such as when the current module is nested (e.g., `mod.submod`) and ensure that the resolution correctly navigates the module hierarchy.\n\nFinally, I'll document the changes and ensure that the code remains clean and maintainable.\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\nI'll start by examining the repository structure to identify where the Python domain code is located.

Let me try to understand the problem first.\n\nFrom the issue description, it seems that when using unqualified class names in these directives, Sphinx is searching all submodules for the class, leading to multiple matches and warnings. For example, using :rtype: A in a function within mod.submod should refer to mod.submod.A, but instead, it's finding both mod.A and mod.submod.A, causing ambiguity.\n\nI remember that in Sphinx, the :py:class: role uses the current module context, but maybe the :type: and :rtype: directives aren't handling the context correctly. They might be treating the type names as global instead of relative to the current module.\n\nSo, the goal is to make sure that when a type is specified without a module (like A), it's resolved relative to the current module, just like the explicit :py:class:`A` does. That way, in mod.submod, A should refer to mod.submod.A.\n\nLooking at the code structure, I think the issue lies in how the type and rtype directives parse their arguments. They might not be using the same mechanism as the explicit roles, which correctly handle the module context.\n\nI should check the code that processes these directives. Probably in the sphinx/domains/python.py file, where the PyClass and PyFunction are defined. The type and rtype handling might be in the PyFunction's methods.\n\nI recall that the PyFunction class has methods to handle parameters and return types. Maybe the way they resolve the type names isn't considering the current module properly.\n\nPerhaps the fix involves modifying how the type names are resolved. Instead of searching globally, they should start from the current module and then look in parent modules if necessary.\n\nI should look for the part of the code where the type is being resolved. Maybe there's a function that takes the type string and returns the target. If that function isn't using the current module context, that's the problem.\n\nOnce I find that, I can adjust it to consider the current module when resolving unqualified type names. This should make the behavior consistent with the explicit :py:class: role.\n\nI also need to make sure that this change doesn't break existing functionality. Testing with different scenarios, like when the current module is set and when it's not, would be important.\n\nAfter making the code changes, I should rerun the test script provided to ensure that the warnings are no longer generated and that the correct classes are referenced.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Explore the repository to find where the type and rtype directives are handled.\n2. Modify the resolution logic to use the current module context.\n3. Test the changes to confirm the fix works and doesn't introduce new issues.\n\nI think that's the plan. Now, I'll proceed to implement these changes.\n"}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1068, "prompt_tokens": 3771, "total_tokens": 4839, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}, "args": [], "kwargs": {"stop": ["</function"], "tool_choice": "none"}, "timestamp": 1739091974.2544909, "cost": 0, "fncall_messages": [{"content": "You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.\n<IMPORTANT>\n* If user provides a path, you should NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory.

This way, `A` becomes `current_module.A`, preventing the ambiguous lookup.\n\nAfter making these changes, I'll test the fix by running the provided test script. This will ensure that the warnings are resolved and that the correct classes are referenced.\n\nAdditionally, I'll consider edge cases, such as when the current module is nested (e.g., `mod.submod`) and ensure that the resolution correctly navigates the module hierarchy.\n\nFinally, I'll document the changes and ensure that the code remains clean and maintainable.\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\nI'll start by examining the repository structure to identify where the Python domain code is located. Then, I'll modify the type resolution logic to respect the current module context.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"index": 1, "function": {"arguments": "{\"command\": \"ls -R /workspace/sphinx-doc__sphinx__3.4/sphinx/domains/\"}", "name": "execute_bash"}, "id": "toolu_01", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1068, "prompt_tokens": 3771, "total_tokens": 4839, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}
