It would be better for consistency if they did, and to reduce the number of code paths.\nOne consequence of the current code is that form._clean_fields() can return a different value from form[name].initial when they should be the same. This case is almost, but not quite, covered by \u200btest_datetime_clean_initial_callable_disabled() (the test can be adjusted to cover this case).\nAs part of this ticket and in line with accessing data through the BoundField objects, I noticed that the code would also be simpler if the per-field logic of changed_data() were moved into a method of the BoundField class. It could be called something like bf.did_change(). This would be more appropriate because whether form data changed for a field is a property of its BoundField (as it depends on the underlying form data), as opposed to the unbound field. With this change, the method could change from its current ~20 lines to something like this--\n@cached_property\ndef changed_data(self):\n\treturn [name for name, bf in self._bound_items() if bf._did_change()]\nA similar change could be made to BaseForm._clean_fields().\n\n</issue_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <issue_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>.

Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe issue is about BaseForm's _clean_fields() and changed_data not using BoundField objects. The goal is to make these methods access values through BoundField for consistency and to reduce code paths. Additionally, moving the per-field logic into a BoundField method called _did_change() is suggested, which would simplify the code.\n\nFirst, I should explore the repository structure. The user provided a directory named django__django__4.0, so I'll look for the relevant files there. The main files involved are likely form.py and forms.py, which are part of Django's forms handling.\n\nI'll start by examining the current implementation of _clean_fields() and changed_data in form.py. The current code probably accesses the initial and data directly without using BoundField. My task is to modify these methods to use BoundField.\n\nFor _clean_fields(), I'll need to loop through each BoundField and call a method on it, perhaps something like _get_cleaned_value(), which would handle the cleaning process. This way, the cleaning is done through the BoundField, ensuring consistency.\n\nNext, for changed_data, the current implementation checks if the data has changed by comparing initial and data. I'll refactor this by adding a method to BoundField, maybe _did_change(), which checks if the data has changed. Then, changed_data can simply collect the names of fields where this method returns True.\n\nI should also consider edge cases. For example, if a field's initial value is a callable, it should be handled correctly. Also, fields that are not required but have data should be considered as changed. I'll need to ensure that all these scenarios are covered after the refactor.\n\nNow, I'll create a script to reproduce the error. This script will define a form, set initial values, and check if the changed_data and cleaned data behave as expected before and after the fix. By running this script, I can confirm that the issue exists and that my changes resolve it.\n\nOnce the script is ready, I'll execute it using the BashTool. If the script shows that the issue is present, I'll proceed with modifying the source code.\n\nIn the form.py file, I'll add the _did_change() method to BoundField. This method will compare the initial value and the data, taking into account callables for initial values. Then, I'll update the changed_data property to use this new method.\n\nSimilarly, I'll modify _clean_fields() to iterate over each BoundField and call a method to get the cleaned value. This ensures that the cleaning process is handled through the BoundField, maintaining consistency.\n\nAfter making these changes, I'll rerun the script to verify that the issue is fixed. The script should now pass without errors, indicating that the changes are effective.\n\nI should also think about any potential side effects. For instance, ensuring that other parts of the code that rely on changed_data or _clean_fields() are not broken by these changes. Testing with various field types and scenarios will help confirm that everything works as expected.\n\nIn summary, the steps are: explore the repo, create a test script, modify the relevant methods to use BoundField, and verify the changes. This approach ensures that the issue is addressed thoroughly and that all edge cases are considered.\n"}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1213, "prompt_tokens": 3523, "total_tokens": 4736, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}, "args": [], "kwargs": {"stop": ["</function"], "tool_choice": "none"}, "timestamp": 1739081951.6317523, "cost": 0, "fncall_messages": [{"content": "You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.\n<IMPORTANT>\n* If user provides a path, you should NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory.
