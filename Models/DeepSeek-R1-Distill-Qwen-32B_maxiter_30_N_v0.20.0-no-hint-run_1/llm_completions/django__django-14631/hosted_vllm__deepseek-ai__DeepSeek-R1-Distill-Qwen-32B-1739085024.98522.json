Consider the following issue description:\n\n<issue_description>\nBaseForm's _clean_fields() and changed_data should access values via BoundField\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Chris Jerdonek)\n\t \nWhile working on #32917, I noticed that \u200bBaseForm._clean_fields() and \u200bBaseForm.changed_data don't currently access their values through a BoundField object. It would be better for consistency if they did, and to reduce the number of code paths.\nOne consequence of the current code is that form._clean_fields() can return a different value from form[name].initial when they should be the same. This case is almost, but not quite, covered by \u200btest_datetime_clean_initial_callable_disabled() (the test can be adjusted to cover this case).\nAs part of this ticket and in line with accessing data through the BoundField objects, I noticed that the code would also be simpler if the per-field logic of changed_data() were moved into a method of the BoundField class. It could be called something like bf.did_change(). This would be more appropriate because whether form data changed for a field is a property of its BoundField (as it depends on the underlying form data), as opposed to the unbound field. With this change, the method could change from its current ~20 lines to something like this--\n@cached_property\ndef changed_data(self):\n\treturn [name for name, bf in self._bound_items() if bf._did_change()]\nA similar change could be made to BaseForm._clean_fields().\n\n</issue_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <issue_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /workspace directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.\nPlease structure your response using the format specified in the system prompt above, with clear <|begin_of_thought|> and <|begin_of_solution|> sections.\n\n--------------------- END OF NEW TASK DESCRIPTION --------------------- \n\nREASON AS MUCH AS NEEDED, BUT RESPECT THE FORMAT STRICTLY! AFTER REASONING, EMIT ONE AND ONLY ONE FUNCTION CALL PER MESSAGE.\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<|begin_of_thought|>\nAlright, let's tackle this issue step by step. The goal is to modify Django's BaseForm to access values through BoundField objects for consistency and to simplify the code.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the current structure of the Django repository. The main files involved in form handling are likely in the `django/forms` directory. Specifically, I'll need to look at:\n\n1. `django/forms/forms.py` - This contains the BaseForm class\n2. `django/forms/models.py` - For model form handling\n3. `django/forms/boundfield.py` - Contains the BoundField class\n\nNext, I'll create a test script to reproduce the issue. The issue mentions that `form._clean_fields()` can return different values from `form[name].initial`. I'll create a simple form and test this behavior.\n\nAfter setting up the test, I'll proceed with the code changes:\n\n1. Modify `BaseForm.changed_data` to use a new `BoundField.did_change()` method\n2. Implement `BoundField.did_change()` that checks if the field's value has changed\n3. Update `BaseForm._clean_fields()` to access values through BoundField\n\nI'll also need to ensure that all edge cases are handled, such as:\n- Different field types (CharField, DateTimeField, etc.)\n- Initial values set via callable\n- Form validation errors\n- Multiple forms in a formset\n\nFinally, I'll run the test script again to verify the fix and ensure no regressions were introduced.\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\nLet's start by creating a test script to reproduce the issue:\n\n<function=execute_bash>\n<parameter=command>\necho \"from django import forms\nclass TestForm(forms.Form):\n    datetime = forms.DateTimeField()\n    \ndef test_initial_value():\n    initial = {'datetime': '2024-01-01 00:00:00'}\n    form = TestForm(initial=initial)\n    form.data = {'datetime': '2024-01-02 00:00:00'}\n    \n    # Access initial via BoundField\n    bound_field = form['datetime']\n    initial_bound = bound_field.initial\n    \n    # Access initial via _clean_fields\n    form.is_valid()\n    cleaned_data = form.cleaned_data\n    initial_cleaned = cleaned_data.get('datetime')\n    \n    assert initial_bound == initial_cleaned, 'Initial values differ'\n    \nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    test_initial_value()\" > test_form_initial.py\n</parameter>\n</function>"}, {"role": "user", "content": "EXECUTION RESULT of [execute_bash]:\necho \"from django import forms\nclass TestForm(forms.Form):\n    datetime = forms.DateTimeField()\n\ndef test_initial_value():\n    initial = {'datetime': '2024-01-01 00:00:00'}\n    form = TestForm(initial=initial)\n    form.data = {'datetime': '2024-01-02 00:00:00'}\n\n    # Access initial via BoundField\n    bound_field = form['datetime']\n    initial_bound = bound_field.initial\n\n    # Access initial via _clean_fields\n    form.is_valid()\n    cleaned_data = form.cleaned_data\n    initial_cleaned = cleaned_data.get('datetime')\n\n    assert initial_bound == initial_cleaned, 'Initial values differ'\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    test_initial_value()\" > test_form_initial.py\n[The command completed with exit code 0.]\n[Current working directory: /workspace/django__django__4.0]\n[Python interpreter: /opt/miniconda3/envs/testbed/bin/python]\n[Command finished with exit code 0]"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's run the test script to confirm the issue:\n\n<function=execute_bash>\n<parameter=command>python3 test_form_initial.py</parameter>\n</function>"}, {"role": "user", "content": "EXECUTION RESULT of [execute_bash]:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"test_form_initial.py\", line 22, in <module>\n    test_initial_value()\n  File \"test_form_initial.py\", line 7, in test_initial_value\n    form = TestForm(initial=initial)\n  File \"/workspace/django__django__4.0/django/forms/forms.py\", line 76, in __init__\n    self.label_suffix = label_suffix if label_suffix is not None else _(':')\n  File \"/workspace/django__django__4.0/django/utils/translation/__init__.py\", line 74, in gettext\n    return _trans.gettext(message)\n  File \"/workspace/django__django__4.0/django/utils/translation/__init__.py\", line 50, in __getattr__\n    if settings.USE_I18N:\n  File \"/workspace/django__django__4.0/django/conf/__init__.py\", line 69, in __getattr__\n    self._setup(name)\n  File \"/workspace/django__django__4.0/django/conf/__init__.py\", line 50, in _setup\n    raise ImproperlyConfigured(\ndjango.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured: Requested setting USE_I18N, but settings are not configured.

It would be better for consistency if they did, and to reduce the number of code paths.\nOne consequence of the current code is that form._clean_fields() can return a different value from form[name].initial when they should be the same. This case is almost, but not quite, covered by \u200btest_datetime_clean_initial_callable_disabled() (the test can be adjusted to cover this case).\nAs part of this ticket and in line with accessing data through the BoundField objects, I noticed that the code would also be simpler if the per-field logic of changed_data() were moved into a method of the BoundField class. It could be called something like bf.did_change(). This would be more appropriate because whether form data changed for a field is a property of its BoundField (as it depends on the underlying form data), as opposed to the unbound field. With this change, the method could change from its current ~20 lines to something like this--\n@cached_property\ndef changed_data(self):\n\treturn [name for name, bf in self._bound_items() if bf._did_change()]\nA similar change could be made to BaseForm._clean_fields().\n\n</issue_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <issue_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /workspace directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.\nPlease structure your response using the format specified in the system prompt above, with clear <|begin_of_thought|> and <|begin_of_solution|> sections.\n", "role": "user"}, {"content": "<|begin_of_thought|>\nAlright, let's tackle this issue step by step. The goal is to modify Django's BaseForm to access values through BoundField objects for consistency and to simplify the code.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the current structure of the Django repository. The main files involved in form handling are likely in the `django/forms` directory. Specifically, I'll need to look at:\n\n1. `django/forms/forms.py` - This contains the BaseForm class\n2. `django/forms/models.py` - For model form handling\n3. `django/forms/boundfield.py` - Contains the BoundField class\n\nNext, I'll create a test script to reproduce the issue. The issue mentions that `form._clean_fields()` can return different values from `form[name].initial`. I'll create a simple form and test this behavior.\n\nAfter setting up the test, I'll proceed with the code changes:\n\n1. Modify `BaseForm.changed_data` to use a new `BoundField.did_change()` method\n2. Implement `BoundField.did_change()` that checks if the field's value has changed\n3. Update `BaseForm._clean_fields()` to access values through BoundField\n\nI'll also need to ensure that all edge cases are handled, such as:\n- Different field types (CharField, DateTimeField, etc.)\n- Initial values set via callable\n- Form validation errors\n- Multiple forms in a formset\n\nFinally, I'll run the test script again to verify the fix and ensure no regressions were introduced.\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\nLet's start by creating a test script to reproduce the issue:", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"id": "toolu_01", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "execute_bash", "arguments": "{\"command\": \"echo \\\"from django import forms\\nclass TestForm(forms.Form):\\n    datetime = forms.DateTimeField()\\n    \\ndef test_initial_value():\\n    initial = {'datetime': '2024-01-01 00:00:00'}\\n    form = TestForm(initial=initial)\\n    form.data = {'datetime': '2024-01-02 00:00:00'}\\n    \\n    # Access initial via BoundField\\n    bound_field = form['datetime']\\n    initial_bound = bound_field.initial\\n    \\n    # Access initial via _clean_fields\\n    form.is_valid()\\n    cleaned_data = form.cleaned_data\\n    initial_cleaned = cleaned_data.get('datetime')\\n    \\n    assert initial_bound == initial_cleaned, 'Initial values differ'\\n    \\nif __name__ == '__main__':\\n    test_initial_value()\\\" > test_form_initial.py\"}"}}]}, {"content": "echo \"from django import forms\nclass TestForm(forms.Form):\n    datetime = forms.DateTimeField()\n\ndef test_initial_value():\n    initial = {'datetime': '2024-01-01 00:00:00'}\n    form = TestForm(initial=initial)\n    form.data = {'datetime': '2024-01-02 00:00:00'}\n\n    # Access initial via BoundField\n    bound_field = form['datetime']\n    initial_bound = bound_field.initial\n\n    # Access initial via _clean_fields\n    form.is_valid()\n    cleaned_data = form.cleaned_data\n    initial_cleaned = cleaned_data.get('datetime')\n\n    assert initial_bound == initial_cleaned, 'Initial values differ'\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    test_initial_value()\" > test_form_initial.py\n[The command completed with exit code 0.]\n[Current working directory: /workspace/django__django__4.0]\n[Python interpreter: /opt/miniconda3/envs/testbed/bin/python]\n[Command finished with exit code 0]", "role": "tool", "tool_call_id": "toolu_01", "name": "execute_bash"}, {"content": "Let's run the test script to confirm the issue:", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"id": "toolu_02", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "execute_bash", "arguments": "{\"command\": \"python3 test_form_initial.py\"}"}}]}, {"content": "Traceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"test_form_initial.py\", line 22, in <module>\n    test_initial_value()\n  File \"test_form_initial.py\", line 7, in test_initial_value\n    form = TestForm(initial=initial)\n  File \"/workspace/django__django__4.0/django/forms/forms.py\", line 76, in __init__\n    self.label_suffix = label_suffix if label_suffix is not None else _(':')\n  File \"/workspace/django__django__4.0/django/utils/translation/__init__.py\", line 74, in gettext\n    return _trans.gettext(message)\n  File \"/workspace/django__django__4.0/django/utils/translation/__init__.py\", line 50, in __getattr__\n    if settings.USE_I18N:\n  File \"/workspace/django__django__4.0/django/conf/__init__.py\", line 69, in __getattr__\n    self._setup(name)\n  File \"/workspace/django__django__4.0/django/conf/__init__.py\", line 50, in _setup\n    raise ImproperlyConfigured(\ndjango.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured: Requested setting USE_I18N, but settings are not configured.
