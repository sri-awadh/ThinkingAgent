AFTER REASONING, EMIT ONE AND ONLY ONE FUNCTION CALL PER MESSAGE.\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<|begin_of_thought|>\nAlright, let's tackle this issue step by step. The problem is that when unapplying a squashed migration, Django isn't correctly marking the squashed migration itself as unapplied, only the individual migrations it replaces. This can lead to inconsistent migration states.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how Django handles squashed migrations and unapplication. Squashed migrations are meant to replace a series of migrations with a single one, making the history cleaner. However, when unapplying, Django should recognize that the squashed migration needs to be marked as unapplied as well.\n\nI'll start by exploring the repository structure to identify where the migration logic resides. Based on standard Django structure, the migration handling code is likely in `django/db/migrations/executor.py` and `django/db/migrations/graph.py`.\n\nNext, I need to create a minimal reproduction script. This script will:\n1. Create a simple Django project and app\n2. Generate some migrations\n3. Squash them\n4. Apply the squashed migration\n5. Attempt to unapply it\n6. Check if the squashed migration is correctly marked as unapplied\n\nAfter setting up the reproduction script, I'll run it to confirm the issue exists.\n\nOnce the issue is reproduced, I'll look into the Django codebase to find where the unapplication logic is handled. Specifically, I'll examine the `MigrationExecutor.unapply_migration()` method. The current implementation likely only marks the individual migrations as unapplied but not the squashed one.\n\nTo fix this, I'll modify the `unapply_migration()` method to also mark the squashed migration as unapplied if it exists. This involves checking if the migration being unapplied is a squashed one and then marking it accordingly.\n\nAfter making the code changes, I'll rerun the reproduction script to ensure the issue is resolved. Additionally, I'll consider edge cases such as:\n- Unapplying a migration that isn't squashed\n- Unapplying a squashed migration that has dependencies\n- Ensuring that the migration history remains consistent after unapplication\n\nFinally, I'll verify that the changes don't introduce any new issues and that all edge cases are handled properly.\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\nLet's

This ensures that Django can load the settings correctly.\n\n2. **Adjust the Project Structure**: We'll make sure the project directory and files are set up correctly, including the `manage.py` and `settings.py` files.\n\n3. **Run the Script with Correct Settings**: We'll modify the script to use the proper settings configuration and ensure that all necessary Django components are initialized.\n\nHere's the corrected reproduction script:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport sys\nfrom django.core.management import call_command\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom django.apps import AppConfig\nfrom django.conf import settings\n\nclass TestAppConfig(AppConfig):\n    name = 'testapp'\n    verbose_name = \"Test App\"\n\nclass TestModel(models.Model):\n    text = models.CharField(max_length=200)\n\ndef main():\n    # Create a temporary directory for the test project\n    project_dir = 'test_project'\n    os.makedirs(project_dir, exist_ok=True)\n    os.chdir(project_dir)\n\n    # Create settings.py\n    settings_content = \"\"\"\n    SECRET_KEY = 'django-insecure'\n    ROOT_URLCONF = 'test_project.urls'\n    INSTALLED_APPS = [\n        'django.contrib.admin',\n        'django.contrib.auth',\n        'django.contrib.contenttypes',\n        'django.contrib.sessions',\n        'django.contrib.messages',\n        'testapp.apps.TestAppConfig',\n    ]\n    DATABASES = {\n        'default': {\n            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',\n            'NAME': 'db.sqlite3',\n        }\n    }\n    \"\"\"\n    with open('test_project/settings.py', 'w') as f:\n        f.write(settings_content.strip())\n\n    # Create testapp directory\n    os.makedirs('testapp/models', exist_ok=True)\n    with open('testapp/__init__.py', 'w') as f:\n        f.write('')\n\n    with open('testapp/models/__init__.py', 'w') as f:\n        f.write('')\n\n    # Create testapp/models.py\n    with open('testapp/models.py', 'w') as f:\n        f.write('from .models import TestModel')\n\n    # Create testapp/models/models.py\n    with open('testapp/models/models.py', 'w') as f:\n        f.write('from django.db import models\\n\\nclass TestModel(models.Model):\\n    text = models.CharField(max_length=200)')\n\n    # Create testapp/apps.py\n    with open('testapp/apps.py', 'w') as f:\n        f.write('from django.apps import AppConfig\\n\\nclass TestAppConfig(AppConfig):\\n    name = \"testapp\"\\n    verbose_name = \"Test App\"')\n\n    # Create manage.py\n    with open('manage.py', 'w') as f:\n        f.write('#!/usr/bin/env python\\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\\n    from django.core.management import execute_from_command_line\\n    execute_from_command_line(sys.argv)')\n\n    # Set environment variable for Django settings\n    os.environ['DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'] = 'test_project.settings'\n\n    # Make migrations\n    call_command('makemigrations', 'testapp', interactive=False)\n\n    # Squash migrations\n    call_command('squashmigrations', 'testapp', '0001', interactive=False)\n\n    # Apply migrations\n    call_command('migrate', 'testapp', interactive=False)\n\n    # Unapply the squashed migration\n    call_command('migrate', 'testapp', 'zero', interactive=False)\n\n    # Check if the squashed migration is marked as unapplied\n    from django.db.migrations.executor import MigrationExecutor\n    executor = MigrationExecutor(settings)\n    applied_migrations = executor.loader.applied_migrations\n    squashed_migration = next((m for m in executor.loader.all_migrations if m.name == 'squashed_0001'), None)\n\n    if squashed_migration and squashed_migration in applied_migrations:\n        print(\"ERROR: Squashed migration is still marked as applied after unapplying.\")\n        sys.exit(1)\n    else:\n        print(\"Squashed migration was correctly marked as unapplied.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation of Changes:**\n\n1. **Settings Configuration**: The script now creates a proper `settings.py` file within the `test_project` directory. This file includes all necessary Django settings, such as `SECRET_KEY`, `INSTALLED_APPS`, and `DATABASES`.\n\n2. **Environment Variable**: The script sets the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` environment variable to point to the newly created `settings.py` file. This ensures that Django can load the settings correctly.\n\n3. **Project Structure**: The project directory structure is properly set up, including the `manage.py` file and the `testapp` directory with its models and apps configuration.\n\n4. **Running Commands**: The script uses `call_command` to run Django management commands, ensuring that they use the correct settings and project structure.\n\nBy making these changes, the script should now run without the settings configuration error. This will allow us to test the changes made to the `executor.py` file and confirm that squashed migrations are correctly marked as unapplied.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "refusal": null, "reasoning_content": "\nOkay, so I'm trying to help fix this Django issue where squashed migrations aren't being marked as unapplied correctly. I've made some changes to the `executor.py` file, but when I tried to run the reproduction script, it failed with an error about settings not being configured.\n\nHmm, the error message says that the settings aren't configured. I remember that in Django, you need to set up the settings module or configure the settings before running any management commands or accessing models. In the reproduction script, I tried to set up a temporary project with its own settings, but maybe I missed something.\n\nLet me look at the script again. Oh, I see that I'm using `settings.configure()` with some parameters, but perhaps I'm not setting all the necessary settings. Maybe I need to include more settings or adjust how I'm configuring them.\n\nAlso, the script creates a temporary directory and sets up some files, but perhaps the way it's handling the project structure isn't correct. Maybe the `manage.py` file or the `settings.py` isn't properly set up, causing Django to not recognize the project correctly.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the database settings. I'm using SQLite, but maybe the path isn't correct or the database isn't being created properly. Or perhaps the way I'm calling `call_command` is causing issues because it's not finding the right settings.\n\nI should also check if the `INSTALLED_APPS` include all the necessary apps, especially the test app I'm creating. If the test app isn't properly registered, Django might not recognize it, leading to migration issues.\n\nMaybe I should try running the script with more verbose output to see exactly where it's failing. Or perhaps I should use `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` to point to the settings I've created in the script instead of configuring them directly.\n\nWait, in the script, I'm creating a `settings.py` file manually. Maybe I should instead create a proper settings module and set `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` to point to it. That way, Django can load the settings correctly without relying on the `configure()` method, which might not be setting everything up properly.\n\nAlso, I should ensure that the `makemigrations`, `squashmigrations`, and `migrate` commands are being called with the correct arguments and that the test app is properly set up in the project.\n\nPerhaps I should also check if the test app's models are being imported correctly and if the migrations are being generated as expected. If the models aren't properly registered, the migrations might not be created, leading to errors when trying to apply or unapply them.\n\nAnother idea is to use Django's built-in test runner to set up the test environment properly. That way, I can leverage Django's testing framework to handle the project and app setup, which might resolve the settings configuration issue.\n\nI should also consider if there are any dependencies or environment variables that need to be set for the script to run correctly. For example, ensuring that `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` is set or that the project directory is properly recognized.\n\nMaybe I should try running the script step by step in a debugger to see exactly where it's failing. That way, I can identify the exact point where the settings aren't being configured and fix that part.\n\nAlternatively, I could look for similar issues online to see if others have encountered the same problem and how they resolved it. Perhaps there's a common pitfall when setting up Django projects programmatically that I'm not aware of.\n\nIn summary, the main issue seems to be with the Django settings not being configured correctly in the reproduction script. I need to ensure that the settings are properly set up, either by using `settings.configure()` correctly or by creating a proper settings module and using `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE`. Additionally, I should verify that the project and app structures are correctly set up and that all necessary Django components are properly initialized before running the migration commands.\n"}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1958, "prompt_tokens": 14035, "total_tokens": 15993, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}, "args": [], "kwargs": {"stop": ["</function"], "tool_choice": "none"}, "timestamp": 1739083052.4217362, "cost": 0, "fncall_messages": [{"content": "You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.\n<IMPORTANT>\n* If user provides a path, you should NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory.

The problem is that when unapplying a squashed migration, Django isn't correctly marking the squashed migration itself as unapplied, only the individual migrations it replaces. This can lead to inconsistent migration states.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how Django handles squashed migrations and unapplication. Squashed migrations are meant to replace a series of migrations with a single one, making the history cleaner. However, when unapplying, Django should recognize that the squashed migration needs to be marked as unapplied as well.\n\nI'll start by exploring the repository structure to identify where the migration logic resides. Based on standard Django structure, the migration handling code is likely in `django/db/migrations/executor.py` and `django/db/migrations/graph.py`.\n\nNext, I need to create a minimal reproduction script. This script will:\n1. Create a simple Django project and app\n2. Generate some migrations\n3. Squash them\n4. Apply the squashed migration\n5. Attempt to unapply it\n6. Check if the squashed migration is correctly marked as unapplied\n\nAfter setting up the reproduction script, I'll run it to confirm the issue exists.\n\nOnce the issue is reproduced, I'll look into the Django codebase to find where the unapplication logic is handled. Specifically, I'll examine the `MigrationExecutor.unapply_migration()` method. The current implementation likely only marks the individual migrations as unapplied but not the squashed one.\n\nTo fix this, I'll modify the `unapply_migration()` method to also mark the squashed migration as unapplied if it exists. This involves checking if the migration being unapplied is a squashed one and then marking it accordingly.\n\nAfter making the code changes, I'll rerun the reproduction script to ensure the issue is resolved. Additionally, I'll consider edge cases such as:\n- Unapplying a migration that isn't squashed\n- Unapplying a squashed migration that has dependencies\n- Ensuring that the migration history remains consistent after unapplication\n\nFinally, I'll verify that the changes don't introduce any new issues and that all edge cases are handled properly.\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\nLet's

This ensures that Django can load the settings correctly.\n\n2. **Adjust the Project Structure**: We'll make sure the project directory and files are set up correctly, including the `manage.py` and `settings.py` files.\n\n3. **Run the Script with Correct Settings**: We'll modify the script to use the proper settings configuration and ensure that all necessary Django components are initialized.\n\nHere's the corrected reproduction script:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport sys\nfrom django.core.management import call_command\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom django.apps import AppConfig\nfrom django.conf import settings\n\nclass TestAppConfig(AppConfig):\n    name = 'testapp'\n    verbose_name = \"Test App\"\n\nclass TestModel(models.Model):\n    text = models.CharField(max_length=200)\n\ndef main():\n    # Create a temporary directory for the test project\n    project_dir = 'test_project'\n    os.makedirs(project_dir, exist_ok=True)\n    os.chdir(project_dir)\n\n    # Create settings.py\n    settings_content = \"\"\"\n    SECRET_KEY = 'django-insecure'\n    ROOT_URLCONF = 'test_project.urls'\n    INSTALLED_APPS = [\n        'django.contrib.admin',\n        'django.contrib.auth',\n        'django.contrib.contenttypes',\n        'django.contrib.sessions',\n        'django.contrib.messages',\n        'testapp.apps.TestAppConfig',\n    ]\n    DATABASES = {\n        'default': {\n            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',\n            'NAME': 'db.sqlite3',\n        }\n    }\n    \"\"\"\n    with open('test_project/settings.py', 'w') as f:\n        f.write(settings_content.strip())\n\n    # Create testapp directory\n    os.makedirs('testapp/models', exist_ok=True)\n    with open('testapp/__init__.py', 'w') as f:\n        f.write('')\n\n    with open('testapp/models/__init__.py', 'w') as f:\n        f.write('')\n\n    # Create testapp/models.py\n    with open('testapp/models.py', 'w') as f:\n        f.write('from .models import TestModel')\n\n    # Create testapp/models/models.py\n    with open('testapp/models/models.py', 'w') as f:\n        f.write('from django.db import models\\n\\nclass TestModel(models.Model):\\n    text = models.CharField(max_length=200)')\n\n    # Create testapp/apps.py\n    with open('testapp/apps.py', 'w') as f:\n        f.write('from django.apps import AppConfig\\n\\nclass TestAppConfig(AppConfig):\\n    name = \"testapp\"\\n    verbose_name = \"Test App\"')\n\n    # Create manage.py\n    with open('manage.py', 'w') as f:\n        f.write('#!/usr/bin/env python\\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\\n    from django.core.management import execute_from_command_line\\n    execute_from_command_line(sys.argv)')\n\n    # Set environment variable for Django settings\n    os.environ['DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'] = 'test_project.settings'\n\n    # Make migrations\n    call_command('makemigrations', 'testapp', interactive=False)\n\n    # Squash migrations\n    call_command('squashmigrations', 'testapp', '0001', interactive=False)\n\n    # Apply migrations\n    call_command('migrate', 'testapp', interactive=False)\n\n    # Unapply the squashed migration\n    call_command('migrate', 'testapp', 'zero', interactive=False)\n\n    # Check if the squashed migration is marked as unapplied\n    from django.db.migrations.executor import MigrationExecutor\n    executor = MigrationExecutor(settings)\n    applied_migrations = executor.loader.applied_migrations\n    squashed_migration = next((m for m in executor.loader.all_migrations if m.name == 'squashed_0001'), None)\n\n    if squashed_migration and squashed_migration in applied_migrations:\n        print(\"ERROR: Squashed migration is still marked as applied after unapplying.\")\n        sys.exit(1)\n    else:\n        print(\"Squashed migration was correctly marked as unapplied.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n**Explanation of Changes:**\n\n1. **Settings Configuration**: The script now creates a proper `settings.py` file within the `test_project` directory. This file includes all necessary Django settings, such as `SECRET_KEY`, `INSTALLED_APPS`, and `DATABASES`.\n\n2. **Environment Variable**: The script sets the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` environment variable to point to the newly created `settings.py` file. This ensures that Django can load the settings correctly.\n\n3. **Project Structure**: The project directory structure is properly set up, including the `manage.py` file and the `testapp` directory with its models and apps configuration.\n\n4. **Running Commands**: The script uses `call_command` to run Django management commands, ensuring that they use the correct settings and project structure.\n\nBy making these changes, the script should now run without the settings configuration error. This will allow us to test the changes made to the `executor.py` file and confirm that squashed migrations are correctly marked as unapplied.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "refusal": null, "reasoning_content": "\nOkay, so I'm trying to help fix this Django issue where squashed migrations aren't being marked as unapplied correctly. I've made some changes to the `executor.py` file, but when I tried to run the reproduction script, it failed with an error about settings not being configured.\n\nHmm, the error message says that the settings aren't configured. I remember that in Django, you need to set up the settings module or configure the settings before running any management commands or accessing models. In the reproduction script, I tried to set up a temporary project with its own settings, but maybe I missed something.\n\nLet me look at the script again. Oh, I see that I'm using `settings.configure()` with some parameters, but perhaps I'm not setting all the necessary settings. Maybe I need to include more settings or adjust how I'm configuring them.\n\nAlso, the script creates a temporary directory and sets up some files, but perhaps the way it's handling the project structure isn't correct. Maybe the `manage.py` file or the `settings.py` isn't properly set up, causing Django to not recognize the project correctly.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the database settings. I'm using SQLite, but maybe the path isn't correct or the database isn't being created properly. Or perhaps the way I'm calling `call_command` is causing issues because it's not finding the right settings.\n\nI should also check if the `INSTALLED_APPS` include all the necessary apps, especially the test app I'm creating. If the test app isn't properly registered, Django might not recognize it, leading to migration issues.\n\nMaybe I should try running the script with more verbose output to see exactly where it's failing. Or perhaps I should use `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` to point to the settings I've created in the script instead of configuring them directly.\n\nWait, in the script, I'm creating a `settings.py` file manually. Maybe I should instead create a proper settings module and set `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` to point to it. That way, Django can load the settings correctly without relying on the `configure()` method, which might not be setting everything up properly.\n\nAlso, I should ensure that the `makemigrations`, `squashmigrations`, and `migrate` commands are being called with the correct arguments and that the test app is properly set up in the project.\n\nPerhaps I should also check if the test app's models are being imported correctly and if the migrations are being generated as expected. If the models aren't properly registered, the migrations might not be created, leading to errors when trying to apply or unapply them.\n\nAnother idea is to use Django's built-in test runner to set up the test environment properly. That way, I can leverage Django's testing framework to handle the project and app setup, which might resolve the settings configuration issue.\n\nI should also consider if there are any dependencies or environment variables that need to be set for the script to run correctly. For example, ensuring that `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` is set or that the project directory is properly recognized.\n\nMaybe I should try running the script step by step in a debugger to see exactly where it's failing. That way, I can identify the exact point where the settings aren't being configured and fix that part.\n\nAlternatively, I could look for similar issues online to see if others have encountered the same problem and how they resolved it. Perhaps there's a common pitfall when setting up Django projects programmatically that I'm not aware of.\n\nIn summary, the main issue seems to be with the Django settings not being configured correctly in the reproduction script. I need to ensure that the settings are properly set up, either by using `settings.configure()` correctly or by creating a proper settings module and using `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE`. Additionally, I should verify that the project and app structures are correctly set up and that all necessary Django components are properly initialized before running the migration commands.\n"}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1958, "prompt_tokens": 14035, "total_tokens": 15993, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}
