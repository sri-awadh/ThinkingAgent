Consider the following issue description:\n\n<issue_description>\nAllow ModelForm meta to specify formfield_callback.\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Klaas-Jan Gorter)\n\t \nThe function django.forms.modelform_factory returns a form class based on the class it recieves as form argument. As an additional argument it accepts a formfield_callback function. When no callback is provided the class uses no callback instead of the formfield_callback of the base form provided.\nExample:\nfrom django import forms\nform django.db import models\nclass MyModel(forms.Model):\n\tactive = models.BooleanField()\n\tname = models.CharField(max_length=64, blank=True, null=True)\n\t\ndef all_required(field, **kwargs):\n\tformfield = field.formfield(**kwargs)\n\tformfield.required = True\n\treturn formfield\nclass MyForm(forms.ModelForm):\n\tformfield_callback = all_required\n\tclass Meta:\n\t\tmodel = MyModel\n\t\tformfield_callback = all_required\n\t\tfields = ['active', 'name']\nFactoryForm = forms.modelform_factory(MyModel, form=MyForm)\nThe expected behavior would be that the FactoryForm uses the formfield_callback specified in the Meta attribute of MyForm and that therefore the fields would be required in both the FactoryForm and MyForm. However, under the current behavior of modelform_factory the formfield_callback is overwritten (with the default argument None) before the new class is constructed and in FactoryForm the fields are not required.\nI believe this is a bug, because this behavior has been observed before in Ticket #18573 in Django 1.3. The test that was proposed there was incorrect, because under the expected behavior the callback should have been called four times not two times as was asserted. (I believe this test has been removed from version 2, because I find no equivalent test in tests/model_formsets_regress.)\n\n</issue_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <issue_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>.

AFTER REASONING, EMIT ONE AND ONLY ONE FUNCTION CALL PER MESSAGE.\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<|begin_of_thought|>\nAlright, let's tackle this issue step by step. The problem is that when using `modelform_factory` with a custom `formfield_callback` defined in the `Meta` class of a `ModelForm`, the callback isn't being respected. This means that any custom validation or field modifications defined in the callback aren't being applied when the form is generated.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how `modelform_factory` works. From the code, I know that `modelform_factory` is responsible for creating a `ModelForm` class based on a model and additional parameters. One of these parameters is `formfield_callback`, which allows developers to customize how model fields are converted into form fields.\n\nLooking at the current implementation in `django/forms/models.py`, the `modelform_factory` function accepts a `formfield_callback` parameter. However, when a custom form is provided (using the `form` parameter), the function doesn't properly inherit the `formfield_callback` from the provided form's `Meta` class. This is the root cause of the issue.\n\nTo fix this, I need to modify the `modelform_factory` function to check if the provided form has a `formfield_callback` defined in its `Meta` class. If it does, this callback should be used instead of the default one.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Check if the provided `form` parameter has a `Meta` class.\n2. If it does, check if `Meta` has a `formfield_callback` attribute.\n3. If `formfield_callback` is found in `Meta`, use it as the default callback.\n4. Update the function to use this callback when generating the form fields.\n\nI'll also need to ensure that this change doesn't break any existing functionality. For example, if a user provides both a `form` with a `formfield_callback` and a `formfield_callback` parameter, the parameter should take precedence.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this in code. I'll need to modify the `modelform_factory` function in `django/forms/models.py`. Specifically, I'll add logic to check for the presence of `formfield_callback` in the provided form's `Meta` class before using the default callback.\n\nAfter making these changes, I should test the fix by running the provided script. This will help confirm that the `formfield_callback` is now being respected when using `modelform_factory`.\n\nFinally, I'll consider any edge cases, such as when the `formfield_callback` is `None` or when multiple forms are involved. However, the main fix should handle the general case where the `formfield_callback` is correctly inherited from the provided form's `Meta` class.\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\nLet's implement the necessary changes:\n\n1.

From what I understand, when you create a `ModelForm` and specify a `formfield_callback` in the `Meta` class, it should apply that callback when generating the form fields. But right now, when you use `modelform_factory`, it's ignoring that callback and just using the default one, which is causing problems.\n\nFirst, I need to look at how `modelform_factory` works. It's a function that creates a `ModelForm` class based on a model and some options. One of those options is `formfield_callback`, which is a function that customizes how model fields are converted into form fields. The problem is that when you pass a custom form (like `MyForm` in the example) to `modelform_factory`, it doesn't look at the `formfield_callback` defined in that form's `Meta` class. Instead, it just uses whatever `formfield_callback` is passed as an argument, or None if nothing is provided.\n\nSo, the goal is to modify `modelform_factory` so that if the form passed to it has a `formfield_callback` in its `Meta` class, that callback is used as the default. This way, users don't have to manually pass the callback every time they use `modelform_factory`.\n\nI think the solution involves adding a check inside `modelform_factory` to see if the provided form has a `Meta` class with a `formfield_callback` attribute. If it does, and if no `formfield_callback` is provided in the function call, then use the one from the form's `Meta`.\n\nLet me outline the steps I need to take:\n\n1. **Locate the `modelform_factory` function**: This function is in `django/forms/models.py`. I need to find where it's defined.\n\n2. **Modify the function signature and docstring**: I should update the docstring to explain the new behavior, that is, if the form has a `formfield_callback` in its `Meta`, it will be used as the default.\n\n3. **Add the logic to check for `formfield_callback` in the form's `Meta`**:\n   - Check if the `form` parameter is not None and has a `Meta` class.\n   - If the `Meta` class has a `formfield_callback` attribute, and if `formfield_callback` is None (meaning it wasn't provided in the function call), then set `formfield_callback` to the one from `Meta`.\n\n4. **Ensure backward compatibility**: The change should not break existing functionality. If a `formfield_callback` is explicitly provided, it should take precedence over the one in the form's `Meta`.\n\n5. **Test the changes**: After making the modifications, I should test the function to ensure that it now correctly uses the `formfield_callback` from the form's `Meta` when applicable.\n\nNow, looking at the code, I see that `modelform_factory` starts by processing various parameters. I need to insert the new logic right after the function's docstring but before it proceeds to create the form.\n\nI'll add a conditional block that checks if `form` is provided and has a `Meta` class. If so, it checks for `formfield_callback` in `Meta` and assigns it to the `formfield_callback` variable if it's not already set.\n\nI also need to make sure that the code handles cases where the `form` doesn't have a `Meta` class or where `formfield_callback` isn't defined in `Meta`. In those cases, it should proceed as before.\n\nOnce the code is modified, I can test it by running the example provided in the issue description. If the `FactoryForm` now correctly uses the `formfield_callback` from `MyForm`'s `Meta`, then the fix is successful.\n\nI should also consider edge cases, such as when multiple forms are involved or when `formfield_callback` is `None` in `Meta`. The fix should handle these gracefully without introducing new bugs.\n\nIn summary, the key steps are:\n- Check if the provided form has a `Meta` class with `formfield_callback`.\n- Use that callback as the default if it exists and no other callback is provided.\n- Ensure that the change doesn't affect existing functionality where `formfield_callback` is explicitly passed.\n\nBy following these steps, I can resolve the issue and ensure that `modelform_factory` respects the `formfield_callback` defined in the form's `Meta` class.\n"}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1447, "prompt_tokens": 12766, "total_tokens": 14213, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}, "args": [], "kwargs": {"stop": ["</function"], "tool_choice": "none"}, "timestamp": 1739085618.5060754, "cost": 0, "fncall_messages": [{"content": "You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.\n<IMPORTANT>\n* If user provides a path, you should NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory.

As an additional argument it accepts a formfield_callback function. When no callback is provided the class uses no callback instead of the formfield_callback of the base form provided.\nExample:\nfrom django import forms\nform django.db import models\nclass MyModel(forms.Model):\n\tactive = models.BooleanField()\n\tname = models.CharField(max_length=64, blank=True, null=True)\n\t\ndef all_required(field, **kwargs):\n\tformfield = field.formfield(**kwargs)\n\tformfield.required = True\n\treturn formfield\nclass MyForm(forms.ModelForm):\n\tformfield_callback = all_required\n\tclass Meta:\n\t\tmodel = MyModel\n\t\tformfield_callback = all_required\n\t\tfields = ['active', 'name']\nFactoryForm = forms.modelform_factory(MyModel, form=MyForm)\nThe expected behavior would be that the FactoryForm uses the formfield_callback specified in the Meta attribute of MyForm and that therefore the fields would be required in both the FactoryForm and MyForm. However, under the current behavior of modelform_factory the formfield_callback is overwritten (with the default argument None) before the new class is constructed and in FactoryForm the fields are not required.\nI believe this is a bug, because this behavior has been observed before in Ticket #18573 in Django 1.3. The test that was proposed there was incorrect, because under the expected behavior the callback should have been called four times not two times as was asserted. (I believe this test has been removed from version 2, because I find no equivalent test in tests/model_formsets_regress.)\n\n</issue_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <issue_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>.

The problem is that when using `modelform_factory` with a custom `formfield_callback` defined in the `Meta` class of a `ModelForm`, the callback isn't being respected. This means that any custom validation or field modifications defined in the callback aren't being applied when the form is generated.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how `modelform_factory` works. From the code, I know that `modelform_factory` is responsible for creating a `ModelForm` class based on a model and additional parameters. One of these parameters is `formfield_callback`, which allows developers to customize how model fields are converted into form fields.\n\nLooking at the current implementation in `django/forms/models.py`, the `modelform_factory` function accepts a `formfield_callback` parameter. However, when a custom form is provided (using the `form` parameter), the function doesn't properly inherit the `formfield_callback` from the provided form's `Meta` class. This is the root cause of the issue.\n\nTo fix this, I need to modify the `modelform_factory` function to check if the provided form has a `formfield_callback` defined in its `Meta` class. If it does, this callback should be used instead of the default one.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Check if the provided `form` parameter has a `Meta` class.\n2. If it does, check if `Meta` has a `formfield_callback` attribute.\n3. If `formfield_callback` is found in `Meta`, use it as the default callback.\n4. Update the function to use this callback when generating the form fields.\n\nI'll also need to ensure that this change doesn't break any existing functionality. For example, if a user provides both a `form` with a `formfield_callback` and a `formfield_callback` parameter, the parameter should take precedence.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this in code. I'll need to modify the `modelform_factory` function in `django/forms/models.py`. Specifically, I'll add logic to check for the presence of `formfield_callback` in the provided form's `Meta` class before using the default callback.\n\nAfter making these changes, I should test the fix by running the provided script. This will help confirm that the `formfield_callback` is now being respected when using `modelform_factory`.\n\nFinally, I'll consider any edge cases, such as when the `formfield_callback` is `None` or when multiple forms are involved. However, the main fix should handle the general case where the `formfield_callback` is correctly inherited from the provided form's `Meta` class.\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\nLet's implement the necessary changes:\n\n1.

From what I understand, when you create a `ModelForm` and specify a `formfield_callback` in the `Meta` class, it should apply that callback when generating the form fields. But right now, when you use `modelform_factory`, it's ignoring that callback and just using the default one, which is causing problems.\n\nFirst, I need to look at how `modelform_factory` works. It's a function that creates a `ModelForm` class based on a model and some options. One of those options is `formfield_callback`, which is a function that customizes how model fields are converted into form fields. The problem is that when you pass a custom form (like `MyForm` in the example) to `modelform_factory`, it doesn't look at the `formfield_callback` defined in that form's `Meta` class. Instead, it just uses whatever `formfield_callback` is passed as an argument, or None if nothing is provided.\n\nSo, the goal is to modify `modelform_factory` so that if the form passed to it has a `formfield_callback` in its `Meta` class, that callback is used as the default. This way, users don't have to manually pass the callback every time they use `modelform_factory`.\n\nI think the solution involves adding a check inside `modelform_factory` to see if the provided form has a `Meta` class with a `formfield_callback` attribute. If it does, and if no `formfield_callback` is provided in the function call, then use the one from the form's `Meta`.\n\nLet me outline the steps I need to take:\n\n1. **Locate the `modelform_factory` function**: This function is in `django/forms/models.py`. I need to find where it's defined.\n\n2. **Modify the function signature and docstring**: I should update the docstring to explain the new behavior, that is, if the form has a `formfield_callback` in its `Meta`, it will be used as the default.\n\n3. **Add the logic to check for `formfield_callback` in the form's `Meta`**:\n   - Check if the `form` parameter is not None and has a `Meta` class.\n   - If the `Meta` class has a `formfield_callback` attribute, and if `formfield_callback` is None (meaning it wasn't provided in the function call), then set `formfield_callback` to the one from `Meta`.\n\n4. **Ensure backward compatibility**: The change should not break existing functionality. If a `formfield_callback` is explicitly provided, it should take precedence over the one in the form's `Meta`.\n\n5. **Test the changes**: After making the modifications, I should test the function to ensure that it now correctly uses the `formfield_callback` from the form's `Meta` when applicable.\n\nNow, looking at the code, I see that `modelform_factory` starts by processing various parameters. I need to insert the new logic right after the function's docstring but before it proceeds to create the form.\n\nI'll add a conditional block that checks if `form` is provided and has a `Meta` class. If so, it checks for `formfield_callback` in `Meta` and assigns it to the `formfield_callback` variable if it's not already set.\n\nI also need to make sure that the code handles cases where the `form` doesn't have a `Meta` class or where `formfield_callback` isn't defined in `Meta`. In those cases, it should proceed as before.\n\nOnce the code is modified, I can test it by running the example provided in the issue description. If the `FactoryForm` now correctly uses the `formfield_callback` from `MyForm`'s `Meta`, then the fix is successful.\n\nI should also consider edge cases, such as when multiple forms are involved or when `formfield_callback` is `None` in `Meta`. The fix should handle these gracefully without introducing new bugs.\n\nIn summary, the key steps are:\n- Check if the provided form has a `Meta` class with `formfield_callback`.\n- Use that callback as the default if it exists and no other callback is provided.\n- Ensure that the change doesn't affect existing functionality where `formfield_callback` is explicitly passed.\n\nBy following these steps, I can resolve the issue and ensure that `modelform_factory` respects the `formfield_callback` defined in the form's `Meta` class.\n"}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1447, "prompt_tokens": 12766, "total_tokens": 14213, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}
