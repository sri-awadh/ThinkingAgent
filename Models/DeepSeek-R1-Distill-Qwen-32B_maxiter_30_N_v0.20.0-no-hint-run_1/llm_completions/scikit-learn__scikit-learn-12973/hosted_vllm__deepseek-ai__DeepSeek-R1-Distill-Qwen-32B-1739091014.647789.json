Consider the following issue description:\n\n<issue_description>\nLassoLarsIC: unintuitive copy_X behaviour\nHi, I would like to report what seems to be a bug in the treatment of the `copy_X` parameter of the `LassoLarsIC` class. Because it's a simple bug, it's much easier to see in the code directly than in the execution, so I am not posting steps to reproduce it.\r\n\r\nAs you can see here, LassoLarsIC accepts a copy_X parameter.\r\nhttps://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/7389dbac82d362f296dc2746f10e43ffa1615660/sklearn/linear_model/least_angle.py#L1487\r\n\r\nHowever, it also takes a copy_X parameter a few lines below, in the definition of ```fit```.\r\n    ```def fit(self, X, y, copy_X=True):```\r\n\r\nNow there are two values (potentially contradicting each other) for copy_X and each one is used once. Therefore ```fit``` can have a mixed behaviour. Even worse, this can be completely invisible to the user, since copy_X has a default value of True. Let's assume that I'd like it to be False, and have set it to False in the initialization, `my_lasso = LassoLarsIC(copy_X=False)`. I then call ```my_lasso.fit(X, y)``` and my choice will be silently overwritten. \r\n\r\nIdeally I think that copy_X should be removed as an argument in ```fit```. No other estimator seems to have a duplication in class parameters and fit arguments (I've checked more than ten in the linear models module). However, this would break existing code. Therefore I propose that ```fit``` takes a default value of `None` and only overwrites the existing value if the user has explicitly passed it as an argument to ```fit```. I will submit a PR to that effect.\n\n</issue_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <issue_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>.

AFTER REASONING, EMIT ONE AND ONLY ONE FUNCTION CALL PER MESSAGE.\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<|begin_of_thought|>\nAlright, let's tackle this issue step by step. The problem is that the `LassoLarsIC` class has the `copy_X` parameter defined both in its `__init__` method and in its `fit` method. This duplication can lead to unexpected behavior because the `fit` method's `copy_X` parameter can override the one set during initialization. Our goal is to modify the code so that the `fit` method no longer takes `copy_X` as a parameter, instead using the value set during initialization unless explicitly overridden by the user.\n\nFirst, I'll need to locate the relevant code in the repository. The file in question is `/workspace/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.21/sklearn/linear_model/least_angle.py`. I'll start by examining the `LassoLarsIC` class and its `fit` method.\n\nLooking at the code, I can see that the `fit` method currently has the signature `def fit(self, X, y, copy_X=True):`. My first step is to remove the `copy_X` parameter from this method. Instead, I'll modify the method to accept `**kwargs` to handle any additional parameters that might be passed, though we won't use them for `copy_X`.\n\nNext, I'll need to ensure that within the `fit` method, the `copy_X` value used is the one stored in the instance (`self.copy_X`), which is set during initialization. This means replacing any references to the local `copy_X` parameter with `self.copy_X`.\n\nAfter making these changes, I'll need to test the modified code to ensure that the issue is resolved. I'll create a test script that initializes `LassoLarsIC` with `copy_X=False` and checks whether the original data is modified during the `fit` process. If the fix is correct, the original data should not be copied, and the `fit` method should use the `copy_X` value set during initialization.\n\nI'll also consider edge cases, such as when a user explicitly passes `copy_X` to the `fit` method. According to our fix, this should be ignored, and the instance's `copy_X` value should be used. I'll make sure to test this scenario as well.\n\nFinally, I'll ensure that the documentation for the `fit` method is updated to reflect the removal of the `copy_X` parameter and to clarify that the `copy_X` behavior is now controlled solely by the value set during initialization.\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\nLet's start by modifying the `fit` method in the `LassoLarsIC` class to remove the `copy_X` parameter and use the instance's `copy_X` value instead.\n\n<function=str_replace_editor>\n<parameter=command>str_replace</parameter>\n<parameter=path>/workspace/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.21/sklearn/linear_model/least_angle.py</parameter>\n<parameter=old_str>def fit(self, X, y, copy_X=True):</parameter>\n<parameter=new_str>def fit(self, X, y, **kwargs):</parameter>\n</function>"}, {"role": "user", "content": "EXECUTION RESULT of [str_replace_editor]:\nThe file /workspace/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.21/sklearn/linear_model/least_angle.py has been edited.

The problem is that the `copy_X` parameter is defined both in the class initialization and in the `fit` method. This can cause confusion because if someone sets `copy_X=False` when creating an instance of LassoLarsIC, but then calls `fit` without specifying `copy_X`, it will default to `True` in the `fit` method, overriding the initial setting. That's not good because the user's explicit choice is being ignored.\n\nThe user suggested that the `fit` method should either remove the `copy_X` parameter or make it optional in a way that respects the value set during initialization. They also mentioned that removing `copy_X` from `fit` would be ideal but could break existing code, so they proposed making it `None` by default and only using it if explicitly provided.\n\nSo, my task is to modify the code so that the `fit` method no longer has its own `copy_X` parameter, but instead uses the value from the instance. If the user passes `copy_X` to `fit`, it should override the instance's value. Otherwise, it should use the instance's `copy_X`.\n\nFirst, I need to find where the `fit` method is defined in the code. From the issue description, it's in `least_angle.py`, specifically around line 1487. I'll look for the `fit` method definition.\n\nOnce I locate the `fit` method, I'll see that it currently has `copy_X=True` as a parameter. I need to remove this parameter. But I can't just remove it because that would change the method signature, and existing code that passes `copy_X` to `fit` would break. Instead, I'll change the method to accept `**kwargs` so that any additional arguments can be passed, but `copy_X` won't be a direct parameter anymore.\n\nInside the `fit` method, wherever `copy_X` is used, I'll replace it with `self.copy_X`. But I also need to handle cases where the user might pass `copy_X` as a keyword argument. So, I'll check `kwargs` for `copy_X` and use that value if it's provided; otherwise, use `self.copy_X`.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Modify the `fit` method signature to remove `copy_X` and add `**kwargs`.\n2. Inside the method, set `copy_X = kwargs.get('copy_X', self.copy_X)`.\n3. Ensure that all uses of `copy_X` within the method now use this new assignment.\n\nI also need to make sure that this change doesn't affect other parts of the code. For example, if other methods or classes rely on `fit` having a `copy_X` parameter, this change could cause issues. But according to the user, this duplication isn't present in other estimators, so it's safe to proceed.\n\nAfter making these changes, I should test the modified code to ensure that the `copy_X` behavior works as expected. I'll create a test script where I initialize `LassoLarsIC` with `copy_X=False` and then call `fit` both with and without `copy_X` to see if the correct behavior is observed.\n\nIf everything works as intended, then the issue is resolved. If not, I'll need to debug further, perhaps by adding print statements or using a debugger to see where the `copy_X` value is being set incorrectly.\n\nIn summary, the key steps are modifying the method signature, updating the `copy_X` assignment, and ensuring that the changes don't break existing functionality while respecting the user's initial settings.\n"}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1318, "prompt_tokens": 5307, "total_tokens": 6625, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}, "args": [], "kwargs": {"stop": ["</function"], "tool_choice": "none"}, "timestamp": 1739091014.6477976, "cost": 0, "fncall_messages": [{"content": "You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.\n<IMPORTANT>\n* If user provides a path, you should NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory.

Consider the following issue description:\n\n<issue_description>\nLassoLarsIC: unintuitive copy_X behaviour\nHi, I would like to report what seems to be a bug in the treatment of the `copy_X` parameter of the `LassoLarsIC` class. Because it's a simple bug, it's much easier to see in the code directly than in the execution, so I am not posting steps to reproduce it.\r\n\r\nAs you can see here, LassoLarsIC accepts a copy_X parameter.\r\nhttps://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/7389dbac82d362f296dc2746f10e43ffa1615660/sklearn/linear_model/least_angle.py#L1487\r\n\r\nHowever, it also takes a copy_X parameter a few lines below, in the definition of ```fit```.\r\n    ```def fit(self, X, y, copy_X=True):```\r\n\r\nNow there are two values (potentially contradicting each other) for copy_X and each one is used once. Therefore ```fit``` can have a mixed behaviour. Even worse, this can be completely invisible to the user, since copy_X has a default value of True. Let's assume that I'd like it to be False, and have set it to False in the initialization, `my_lasso = LassoLarsIC(copy_X=False)`. I then call ```my_lasso.fit(X, y)``` and my choice will be silently overwritten. \r\n\r\nIdeally I think that copy_X should be removed as an argument in ```fit```. No other estimator seems to have a duplication in class parameters and fit arguments (I've checked more than ten in the linear models module). However, this would break existing code. Therefore I propose that ```fit``` takes a default value of `None` and only overwrites the existing value if the user has explicitly passed it as an argument to ```fit```. I will submit a PR to that effect.\n\n</issue_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <issue_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>.

The problem is that the `LassoLarsIC` class has the `copy_X` parameter defined both in its `__init__` method and in its `fit` method. This duplication can lead to unexpected behavior because the `fit` method's `copy_X` parameter can override the one set during initialization. Our goal is to modify the code so that the `fit` method no longer takes `copy_X` as a parameter, instead using the value set during initialization unless explicitly overridden by the user.\n\nFirst, I'll need to locate the relevant code in the repository. The file in question is `/workspace/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.21/sklearn/linear_model/least_angle.py`. I'll start by examining the `LassoLarsIC` class and its `fit` method.\n\nLooking at the code, I can see that the `fit` method currently has the signature `def fit(self, X, y, copy_X=True):`. My first step is to remove the `copy_X` parameter from this method. Instead, I'll modify the method to accept `**kwargs` to handle any additional parameters that might be passed, though we won't use them for `copy_X`.\n\nNext, I'll need to ensure that within the `fit` method, the `copy_X` value used is the one stored in the instance (`self.copy_X`), which is set during initialization. This means replacing any references to the local `copy_X` parameter with `self.copy_X`.\n\nAfter making these changes, I'll need to test the modified code to ensure that the issue is resolved. I'll create a test script that initializes `LassoLarsIC` with `copy_X=False` and checks whether the original data is modified during the `fit` process. If the fix is correct, the original data should not be copied, and the `fit` method should use the `copy_X` value set during initialization.\n\nI'll also consider edge cases, such as when a user explicitly passes `copy_X` to the `fit` method. According to our fix, this should be ignored, and the instance's `copy_X` value should be used. I'll make sure to test this scenario as well.\n\nFinally, I'll ensure that the documentation for the `fit` method is updated to reflect the removal of the `copy_X` parameter and to clarify that the `copy_X` behavior is now controlled solely by the value set during initialization.\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\nLet's start by modifying the `fit` method in the `LassoLarsIC` class to remove the `copy_X` parameter and use the instance's `copy_X` value instead.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"id": "toolu_01", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "str_replace_editor", "arguments": "{\"command\": \"str_replace\", \"path\": \"/workspace/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.21/sklearn/linear_model/least_angle.py\", \"old_str\": \"def fit(self, X, y, copy_X=True):\", \"new_str\": \"def fit(self, X, y, **kwargs):\"}"}}]}, {"content": "The file /workspace/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.21/sklearn/linear_model/least_angle.py has been edited.

The problem is that the `copy_X` parameter is defined both in the class initialization and in the `fit` method. This can cause confusion because if someone sets `copy_X=False` when creating an instance of LassoLarsIC, but then calls `fit` without specifying `copy_X`, it will default to `True` in the `fit` method, overriding the initial setting. That's not good because the user's explicit choice is being ignored.\n\nThe user suggested that the `fit` method should either remove the `copy_X` parameter or make it optional in a way that respects the value set during initialization. They also mentioned that removing `copy_X` from `fit` would be ideal but could break existing code, so they proposed making it `None` by default and only using it if explicitly provided.\n\nSo, my task is to modify the code so that the `fit` method no longer has its own `copy_X` parameter, but instead uses the value from the instance. If the user passes `copy_X` to `fit`, it should override the instance's value. Otherwise, it should use the instance's `copy_X`.\n\nFirst, I need to find where the `fit` method is defined in the code. From the issue description, it's in `least_angle.py`, specifically around line 1487. I'll look for the `fit` method definition.\n\nOnce I locate the `fit` method, I'll see that it currently has `copy_X=True` as a parameter. I need to remove this parameter. But I can't just remove it because that would change the method signature, and existing code that passes `copy_X` to `fit` would break. Instead, I'll change the method to accept `**kwargs` so that any additional arguments can be passed, but `copy_X` won't be a direct parameter anymore.\n\nInside the `fit` method, wherever `copy_X` is used, I'll replace it with `self.copy_X`. But I also need to handle cases where the user might pass `copy_X` as a keyword argument. So, I'll check `kwargs` for `copy_X` and use that value if it's provided; otherwise, use `self.copy_X`.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Modify the `fit` method signature to remove `copy_X` and add `**kwargs`.\n2. Inside the method, set `copy_X = kwargs.get('copy_X', self.copy_X)`.\n3. Ensure that all uses of `copy_X` within the method now use this new assignment.\n\nI also need to make sure that this change doesn't affect other parts of the code. For example, if other methods or classes rely on `fit` having a `copy_X` parameter, this change could cause issues. But according to the user, this duplication isn't present in other estimators, so it's safe to proceed.\n\nAfter making these changes, I should test the modified code to ensure that the `copy_X` behavior works as expected. I'll create a test script where I initialize `LassoLarsIC` with `copy_X=False` and then call `fit` both with and without `copy_X` to see if the correct behavior is observed.\n\nIf everything works as intended, then the issue is resolved.
