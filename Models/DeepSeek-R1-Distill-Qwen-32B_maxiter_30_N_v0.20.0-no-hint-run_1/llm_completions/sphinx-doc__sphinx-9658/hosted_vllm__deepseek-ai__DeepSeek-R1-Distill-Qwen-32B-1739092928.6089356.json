Consider the following issue description:\n\n<issue_description>\nInherited classes not correctly documented when mocked\n### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nWe're experiencing an issue when documenting classes that inherit mocked classes. However, classes which inherit other classes from our own package are ok.\r\n\r\nThis issue appears to be dependent on the `sphinx` version:\r\n\r\n- `sphinx<3.0`: Everything is OK. \r\n- `sphinx>=3.0 < 3.4.2`: Classes that inherit mocked classes are not documented. (see [sphinx #8164](https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/8164)). This is fixed in `sphinx 3.4.2`. \r\n- `sphinx>=3.4.2`: The previously missing classes are now documented, but there is a problem with the \"Bases\" section in the docs. \r\n \r\nExample: In the docs for `alibi_detect.utils.pytorch.kernels.DeepKernel` in this readthedocs build https://seldon--338.org.readthedocs.build/projects/alibi-detect/en/338/api/alibi_detect.utils.pytorch.kernels.html, the base class is listed as \"Bases: `torch.nn.`\" instead of \"Bases: `torch.nn.Module`\". \r\n\r\n\r\n### How to Reproduce\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/ascillitoe/alibi-detect.git\r\n$ cd alibi-detect\r\n$ pip install -r requirements/docs.txt\r\n$ make build_docs\r\n$ # open doc/_build/html/api/alibi_detect.utils.pytorch.kernels.html and see \"Bases\" section.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe \"Bases\" section should report `torch.nn.Module` not `torch.nn.`. \r\n\r\ni.e. see\r\nhttps://seldon--325.org.readthedocs.build/projects/alibi-detect/en/325/api/alibi_detect.utils.pytorch.kernels.html\r\n\r\n### Your project\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ascillitoe/alibi-detect/tree/feature_sphinx4\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\n### Screenshot with `sphinx==4.2`\r\n![sphinx_problem](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32061685/133816582-ca162b07-41c7-4b8e-98ea-781e7c659229.png)\r\n\r\n### Screenshot with `sphinx<3.0`\r\n![sphinx_working](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32061685/133816065-6291ce1b-96cf-4b0f-9648-7f993fc15611.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### OS\r\n\r\nUbuntu 18.04 (used by readthedocs/build:6.0)\r\n\r\n### Python version\r\n\r\n3.8.11\r\n\r\n### Sphinx version\r\n\r\n`>=3.4.2`\r\n\r\n### Sphinx extensions\r\n\r\n    [\"sphinx.ext.autodoc\",\r\n    \"sphinx.ext.doctest\",\r\n    \"sphinx.ext.intersphinx\",\r\n    \"sphinx.ext.todo\",\r\n    \"sphinx.ext.coverage\",\r\n    \"sphinx.ext.mathjax\",\r\n    \"sphinx.ext.ifconfig\",\r\n    \"sphinx.ext.viewcode\",\r\n    \"sphinx.ext.napoleon\",\r\n    \"sphinx_autodoc_typehints\",\r\n    \"sphinxcontrib.apidoc\", \r\n    \"nbsphinx\",\r\n    \"nbsphinx_link\",  \r\n    \"myst_parser\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n### Extra tools\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\ndemo PR:\r\nhttps://github.com/SeldonIO/alibi-detect/pull/338\r\n\r\nreadthedocs demo build:\r\nhttps://seldon--338.org.readthedocs.build/projects/alibi-detect/en/338/api/alibi_detect.utils.pytorch.kernels.html\r\n\r\n\n\n</issue_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <issue_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>.

AFTER REASONING, EMIT ONE AND ONLY ONE FUNCTION CALL PER MESSAGE.\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<|begin_of_thought|>\nAlright, let's tackle this issue step by step. The problem is that when using Sphinx >=3.4.2, the documentation for classes inheriting from mocked base classes (like `torch.nn.Module`) doesn't display the base classes correctly. Instead of showing `torch.nn.Module`, it shows `torch.nn.`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand why this is happening. From the issue description, it seems that this is a regression introduced in Sphinx >=3.4.2. In earlier versions (>=3.0 <3.4.2), the classes weren't documented at all, but after 3.4.2, while the classes are documented, the base classes aren't displayed correctly.\n\nThe likely cause is how Sphinx handles mocked modules. When a module is mocked, Sphinx doesn't load the actual module, which can lead to issues with introspection. In this case, the `torch` module is probably being mocked, which affects the ability of Sphinx to correctly identify and display the base classes.\n\nTo fix this, I need to adjust the mocking configuration in the Sphinx `conf.py` file. Instead of mocking the entire `torch` module, we can mock only specific submodules that aren't needed for the documentation. This way, when a class inherits from `torch.nn.Module`, Sphinx can still access the `torch.nn` module to correctly display the base class.\n\nHere's what I'll do:\n1. Identify where the `torch` module is being mocked in `conf.py`.\n2. Modify the mocking to only include specific submodules of `torch` that aren't needed for the documentation.\n3. Ensure that `torch.nn` is not mocked so that Sphinx can access it during documentation generation.\n\nBy making these changes, the base classes should be correctly displayed in the documentation.\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\nLet's start by examining the current configuration in `conf.py` to see how the `torch` module is being mocked.

The problem is that when they use Sphinx version 3.4.2 or higher, the base classes in the documentation aren't showing up correctly. Instead of showing the full class name like `torch.nn.Module`, it's just showing `torch.nn.`. \n\nFrom the issue description, I understand that this is a regression because in earlier versions of Sphinx, the classes weren't documented at all, but after 3.4.2, while the classes are documented, the base classes aren't displayed correctly. \n\nI think the root cause is related to how Sphinx handles mocked modules. When a module is mocked, Sphinx doesn't load the actual module, which can lead to issues with introspection. In this case, the `torch` module is probably being mocked, which affects the ability of Sphinx to correctly identify and display the base classes.\n\nSo, the solution should involve adjusting the mocking configuration in the Sphinx `conf.py` file.

This way, when a class inherits from `torch.nn.Module`, Sphinx can still access the `torch.nn` module to correctly display the base class.\n\nFirst, I need to check where the `torch` module is being mocked in `conf.py`. I'll look for the `autodoc_mock_imports` setting. If `torch` is in that list, I should remove it or adjust it to only mock specific submodules.\n\nIf `torch` isn't being mocked, maybe it's being imported in a way that causes issues. Alternatively, perhaps the `autodoc` extension isn't properly configured to handle these cases.\n\nI'll start by examining the `conf.py` file to see how the `torch` module is being handled. If it's being mocked, I'll modify the mocking to exclude `torch.nn` so that Sphinx can access it during documentation generation.\n\nOnce I make these changes, I'll rerun the documentation build to see if the base classes are now displayed correctly. If not, I might need to adjust the mocking further or look into other configurations that could be affecting this behavior.\n\nIn summary, the key steps are:\n1. Check the current mocking configuration in `conf.py`.\n2. Adjust the mocking to exclude `torch.nn` or only mock specific submodules.\n3.

The problem is that when using Sphinx >=3.4.2, the documentation for classes inheriting from mocked base classes (like `torch.nn.Module`) doesn't display the base classes correctly. Instead of showing `torch.nn.Module`, it shows `torch.nn.`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand why this is happening. From the issue description, it seems that this is a regression introduced in Sphinx >=3.4.2. In earlier versions (>=3.0 <3.4.2), the classes weren't documented at all, but after 3.4.2, while the classes are documented, the base classes aren't displayed correctly.\n\nThe likely cause is how Sphinx handles mocked modules. When a module is mocked, Sphinx doesn't load the actual module, which can lead to issues with introspection. In this case, the `torch` module is probably being mocked, which affects the ability of Sphinx to correctly identify and display the base classes.\n\nTo fix this, I need to adjust the mocking configuration in the Sphinx `conf.py` file. Instead of mocking the entire `torch` module, we can mock only specific submodules that aren't needed for the documentation. This way, when a class inherits from `torch.nn.Module`, Sphinx can still access the `torch.nn` module to correctly display the base class.\n\nHere's what I'll do:\n1. Identify where the `torch` module is being mocked in `conf.py`.\n2. Modify the mocking to only include specific submodules of `torch` that aren't needed for the documentation.\n3. Ensure that `torch.nn` is not mocked so that Sphinx can access it during documentation generation.\n\nBy making these changes, the base classes should be correctly displayed in the documentation.\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\nLet's start by examining the current configuration in `conf.py` to see how the `torch` module is being mocked.
