INITIAL ISSUE:
################################################################################
You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.
<IMPORTANT>
* If user provides a path, you should NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. Instead, you should explore the file system to find the file before working on it.
* When configuring git credentials, use "openhands" as the user.name and "openhands@all-hands.dev" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
* The assistant MUST NOT include comments in the code unless they are necessary to describe non-obvious behavior.
RuntimeInfo(available_hosts={})
</IMPORTANT>
You have access to the following functions:

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #1: execute_bash ----
Description: Execute a bash command in the terminal.
* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, it should be run in the background and the output should be redirected to a file, e.g. command = `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`.
* Interactive: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. The assistant must then send a second call to terminal with an empty `command` (which will retrieve any additional logs), or it can send additional text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process, or it can send command like `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the process.

Parameters:
  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty string to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the currently running process.
---- END FUNCTION #1 ----

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: finish ----
Description: Finish the interaction when the task is successfully complete.
No parameters are required for this function.
---- END FUNCTION #2 ----

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: help ----
Description: Request assistance when the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.
No parameters are required for this function.
---- END FUNCTION #3 ----

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #4: str_replace_editor ----
Description: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files
* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user
* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep
* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file
* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`
* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`

Notes for using the `str_replace` command:
* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!
* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique
* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`

Parameters:
  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.
Allowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]
  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/workspace/file.py` or `/workspace`.
  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.
  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.
  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.
  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.
  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.
---- END FUNCTION #4 ----


If you choose to call a function ONLY reply in the following format with NO suffix:

<function=example_function_name>
<parameter=example_parameter_1>value_1</parameter>
<parameter=example_parameter_2>
This is the value for the second parameter
that can span
multiple lines
</parameter>
</function>

<IMPORTANT>
Reminder:
- Function calls MUST follow the specified format, start with <function= and end with </function>
- Required parameters MUST be specified
- Only call one function at a time
- You may provide optional reasoning for your function call in natural language BEFORE the function call, but NOT after.
- If there is no function call available, answer the question like normal with your current knowledge and do not tell the user about function calls


Here's a running example of how to perform a task with the provided tools.

--------------------- START OF EXAMPLE ---------------------

USER: Create a list of numbers from 1 to 10, and display them in a web page at port 5000.

ASSISTANT: Sure! Let me first check the current directory:
<function=execute_bash>
<parameter=command>
pwd && ls
</parameter>
</function>

USER: EXECUTION RESULT of [execute_bash]:
/workspace
openhands@runtime:~/workspace$

ASSISTANT: There is no `app.py` file in the current directory. Let me create a Python file `app.py`:
<function=str_replace_editor>
<parameter=command>create</parameter>
<parameter=path>/workspace/app.py</parameter>
<parameter=file_text>
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    numbers = list(range(1, 11))
    return str(numbers)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(port=5000)
</parameter>
</function>

USER: EXECUTION RESULT of [str_replace_editor]:
File created successfully at: /workspace/app.py

ASSISTANT: I have created a Python file `app.py` that will display a list of numbers from 1 to 10 when you run it. Let me run the Python file for you:
<function=execute_bash>
<parameter=command>
python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &
</parameter>
</function>

USER: EXECUTION RESULT of [execute_bash]:
[1] 121
[1]+  Exit 1                  python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1

ASSISTANT: Looks like the server is running with PID 121 then crashed. Let me check the server log:
<function=execute_bash>
<parameter=command>
cat server.log
</parameter>
</function>

USER: EXECUTION RESULT of [execute_bash]:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/workspace/app.py", line 2, in <module>
    from flask import Flask
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'flask'

ASSISTANT: Looks like the server crashed because the `flask` module is not installed. Let me install the `flask` module for you:
<function=execute_bash>
<parameter=command>
pip3 install flask
</parameter>
</function>

--------------------- NEW TASK DESCRIPTION ---------------------
<uploaded_files>
/workspace/django__django__5.0
</uploaded_files>
I've uploaded a python code repository in the directory django__django__5.0. Consider the following PR description:

<pr_description>
Django Admin with Inlines not using UUIDField default value
Description
	 
		(last modified by Joseph Metzinger)
	 
Hello,
I am a long time django user, first time bug reporter, so please let me know if I need to do anything else to help get this bug fixed :)
I am using Django 3.1.3 and python 3.8.5 and have cerated a toy project to illustrate the bug. I have the following models:
class UUIDModel(models.Model):
	pkid = models.BigAutoField(primary_key=True, editable=False)
	id = models.UUIDField(default=uuid.uuid4, editable=False, unique=True)
	class Meta:
		abstract = True
class Thing(UUIDModel):
	name = models.CharField(max_length=191)
class SubThing(models.Model):
	name = models.CharField(max_length=191)
	thing = models.ForeignKey(
		'bugapp.Thing',
		to_field='id',
		on_delete = models.CASCADE,
		related_name='subthings',
	)
And the following admin.py file:
class SubThingInline(admin.StackedInline):
	model = SubThing
@admin.register(Thing)
class ThingAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
	list_display = ('name',)
	ordering = ('pkid',)
	inlines = (SubThingInline,)
When logging into the admin, if you delete all of the entries for "subthings", add a name, and save the model, it will work. As soon as you try to add a subthing alongside the main Thing, it fails with the following exception:
​https://dpaste.com/8EU4FF6RW
It shows that the value of "id" in the Thing model is being set to null.
I believe this is a bug in django.
Thanks!

</pr_description>

Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?
I've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!
Your task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /workspace directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.
Follow these steps to resolve the issue:
1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.
2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error
3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue
4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!
5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well
Your thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.

--------------------- END OF NEW TASK DESCRIPTION ---------------------

PLEASE follow the format strictly! PLEASE EMIT ONE AND ONLY ONE FUNCTION CALL PER MESSAGE.

================================================================================
RESPONSE:
To resolve the issue where Django Admin with inlines fails to use the UUIDField's default value, the root cause lies in how the inline formset initializes the foreign key value. The fix involves modifying the BaseInlineFormSet to correctly reference the specified `to_field` instead of the parent's primary key.

RESPONSE:
To properly fix the inline formset's foreign key assignment, we need to precisely target the existing code line using `self.instance.pk` instead of `pk_value`.

RESPONSE:
To resolve the UUID default value issue in Django Admin inlines, the correct approach is modifying how the foreign key value is assigned in the inline formset. The existing code uses the parent's primary key (pk) instead of the specified `to_field`.

================================================================================
RESPONSE:
To resolve the UUID default value issue in Django Admin inlines, we need to modify how the foreign key is initialized in the inline formset. The correct code replacement targets the `_construct_form` method in `django/forms/models.py` to use the specified `to_field` and generate its default value if the parent instance is unsaved.

        fk_value = self.instance.pk
        if self.fk.remote_field.field_name != self.fk.remote_field.model._meta.pk.name:
            fk_value = getattr(self.instance, self.fk.remote_field.field_name)
</parameter>
<parameter=new_str>
        to_field = self.fk.to_field

            field = self.instance._meta.get_field(to_field)
            if hasattr(field, 'default'):
                fk_value = field.default() if callable(field.default) else field.default

Review the changes and make sure they are as expected. Edit the file again if necessary.

================================================================================
LAST RESPONSE:
The changes look correct as they properly handle UUIDField defaults for unsaved parent instances in inline formsets. Let's verify by checking the modified logic:

1. **Before**: The code used `self.instance.pk` which wouldn't exist for unsaved UUID-based parents.
2. **After**: Now properly:
   - Gets the `to_field` from the FK definition
   - Generates default values if needed
   - Sets the value on both the instance and form

This should resolve the null UUID issue when saving new parent+inline combinations. The implementation handles:
- Callable defaults (`default=uuid.uuid4`)
- Non-callable defaults
- Unsaved parent instances
- Correct field assignment
