INITIAL ISSUE:
################################################################################
You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.
<IMPORTANT>
* If user provides a path, you should NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. Instead, you should explore the file system to find the file before working on it.
* When configuring git credentials, use "openhands" as the user.name and "openhands@all-hands.dev" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
* The assistant MUST NOT include comments in the code unless they are necessary to describe non-obvious behavior.
</IMPORTANT>
You have access to the following functions:

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #1: execute_bash ----
Description: Execute a bash command in the terminal.
* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, it should be run in the background and the output should be redirected to a file, e.g. command = `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`.
* Interactive: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. The assistant must then send a second call to terminal with an empty `command` (which will retrieve any additional logs), or it can send additional text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process, or it can send command like `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the process.

Parameters:
  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty string to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the currently running process.
---- END FUNCTION #1 ----

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: finish ----
Description: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.
No parameters are required for this function.
---- END FUNCTION #2 ----

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----
Description: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files
* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user
* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep
* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file
* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`
* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`

Notes for using the `str_replace` command:
* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!
* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique
* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`

Parameters:
  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.
Allowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]
  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/workspace/file.py` or `/workspace`.
  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.
  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.
  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.
  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.
  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.

<uploaded_files>
/workspace/django__django__3.0
</uploaded_files>
I've uploaded a python code repository in the directory django__django__3.0. Consider the following PR description:

<pr_description>
order_by() a parent model crash when Meta.ordering contains expressions.
Description
	 
		(last modified by Jonny Fuller)
	 
Hi friends,
During testing I discovered a strange bug when using a query expression for ordering during multi-table inheritance. You can find the full write up as well as reproducible test repository ​https://github.com/JonnyWaffles/djangoordermetabug. The bug occurs because the field is an OrderBy object, not a string, during get_order_dir. The linked stacktrace should make the issue obvious, but what I don't understand is why it only fails during test db setup, not during repl or script use. I wish I could help more and come up with a real solution. Hopefully, this is enough for someone wiser to find the culprit.

</pr_description>

Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?
I've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!
Your task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /workspace directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.
Follow these steps to resolve the issue:
1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.
2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error
3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue
4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!
5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well
Your thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.

<extra_info>
The following information has been included based on a keyword match for "github". It may or may not be relevant to the user's request.

You have access to an environment variable, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, which allows you to interact with
the GitHub API.

You can use `curl` with the `GITHUB_TOKEN` to interact with GitHub's API.
ALWAYS use the GitHub API for operations instead of a web browser.

Here are some instructions for pushing, but ONLY do this if the user asks you to:
* NEVER push directly to the `main` or `master` branch
* Git config (username and email) is pre-set. Do not modify.
* You may already be on a branch starting with `openhands-workspace`. Create a new branch with a better name before pushing.
* Use the GitHub API to create a pull request, if you haven't already
* Once you've created your own branch or a pull request, continue to update it. Do NOT create a new one unless you are explicitly asked to. Update the PR title and description as necessary, but don't change the branch name.
* Use the main branch as the base branch, unless the user requests otherwise
* After opening or updating a pull request, send the user a short message with a link to the pull request.
* Prefer "Draft" pull requests when possible
* Do all of the above in as few steps as possible. E.g. you could open a PR with one step by running the following bash commands:
```bash
git remote -v && git branch # to find the current org, repo and branch
git checkout -b create-widget && git add . && git commit -m "Create widget" && git push -u origin create-widget
curl -X POST "https://api.github.com/repos/$ORG_NAME/$REPO_NAME/pulls" \

================================================================================
RESPONSE:
Alright, I've got this task to fix an issue in a Django repository. The problem is about ordering a parent model in multi-table inheritance when `Meta.ordering` contains expressions. The PR description mentions that there's a crash, and it only happens during test database setup, not in the REPL or script use. The user has already set up the test files, so I don't need to touch those; I just need to make minimal changes to the non-test files to resolve the issue.

First, I need to understand the structure of the repository. Since it's Django 3.0, I should be familiar with that version, but it's always good to double-check. Multi-table inheritance in Django can be tricky, especially with ordering and expressions.

I should start by exploring the repository to see how the models are defined and where the ordering is specified. Probably, there's a parent model with `Meta.ordering` set to some expression, and when trying to order by that in a query, it's causing a crash during test database setup.

Let me think about how to approach this. I need to reproduce the error first. The user mentioned that there's a reproducible test repository linked in the PR description, but since I have the code in `/workspace/django__django__3.0`, I should be able to run tests or scripts there.

I need to find the script that reproduces the error. Maybe there's a specific test file or a script provided in the repository that demonstrates the issue. Once I can reproduce the error, I can then try to understand why it's happening and fix it.

Let me assume that there's a model defined something like this:

```python
class ParentModel(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    some_field = models.IntegerField()

    class Meta:
        ordering = ['some_expression']

class ChildModel(ParentModel):
    extra_field = models.CharField(max_length=100)
```

And perhaps `some_expression` is an F expression or some other query expression.

First, I need to find where `Meta.ordering` is using an expression. I should search for model classes where `ordering` is set to something other than field names, maybe using F expressions or other query expressions.

Once I find that, I need to see how ordering is being applied in queries, especially in the context of multi-table inheritance.

The error only occurs during test database setup, which is strange. Maybe there's something different about how the test database is set up compared to a regular database.

I should look into Django's test runner and see how it sets up the test database. Perhaps there are differences in migrations or initial data that cause this issue.

Let me think about the steps:

1. Explore the repository to understand the model structure and where `Meta.ordering` is defined with expressions.

2. Find or create a script that reproduces the error. Run it using BashTool to confirm the error.

3. Analyze why the error occurs only during test database setup.

4. Make minimal changes to fix the issue, ensuring that it doesn't break regular usage.

5. Rerun the script to confirm the error is fixed.

6. Consider edge cases to ensure the fix is robust.

Starting with step 1, I need to explore the repository. Since I have access to the file system, I can list the contents of `/workspace/django__django__3.0` to see what's inside.

I'll use the `execute_bash` function to list the directory contents.

<function=execute_bash>
<parameter=command>
ls /workspace/django__django__3.0
</parameter>

RESPONSE:
Okay, so the repository contains various files and directories related to Django. The main code is likely in the `django` directory. I need to look for model definitions, probably in `django/db/models` or similar.

I should look for model classes that use `Meta.ordering` with expressions. Maybe search for `ordering =` in model class definitions.

I can use `grep` to search for `ordering =` in Python files within the `django` directory.

Let me run this command:

<function=execute_bash>
<parameter=command>grep -r "ordering =" /workspace/django__django__3.0/django/db/models/</parameter>

================================================================================
RESPONSE:
Hmm, it seems like the search turned up a lot of results related to ordering, but not necessarily where `Meta.ordering` is defined with expressions. Maybe I need to narrow it down.

Perhaps I should look for model class definitions where `Meta.ordering` is set to a list containing expressions, not just field names.

Alternatively, maybe the issue is in how ordering is handled in the query compiler, given some of the hits are in `compiler.py`.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in how expressions in `Meta.ordering` are handled during query construction, especially in the context of multi-table inheritance.

I need to find where `Meta.ordering` is defined with expressions. Maybe there's a test model set up for this purpose.

Let me check the test files. The user said not to modify test files, but I can look at them to understand the problem.

Assuming that the test files are in `tests/`, I can look for model definitions there.

Let me list the contents of `tests/`:

<function=execute_bash>
<parameter=command>ls /workspace/django__django__3.0/tests</parameter>

RESPONSE:
Okay, there are a lot of test directories and files in `tests/`. I need to find the specific test that demonstrates this issue.

Looking back at the PR description, it mentions a reproducible test repository: https://github.com/JonnyWaffles/djangoordermetabug. Maybe I can look at that repository to understand which test is relevant.

Alternatively, perhaps the user has already set up the necessary test in the repository I have, and I just need to run it.

Let me look for a test file that might be related to ordering and multi-table inheritance.

Perhaps there's a test in `model_inheritance` or `model_inheritance_regress`.

Let me check `tests/model_inheritance/tests.py`:

RESPONSE:
This test file seems to cover various aspects of model inheritance in Django, including abstract classes, multi-table inheritance, and more. However, I don't see any specific test related to ordering with expressions in `Meta.ordering`.

Maybe the test is in another file. Let me look for a test file that mentions ordering or expressions.

Alternatively, perhaps the user has provided a specific script to reproduce the error. Maybe there's a `reproduce_error.py` or similar in the repository.

Let me check for Python files in the root of the repository:

Hmm, these don't seem relevant. Maybe the script is in another directory.

Alternatively, perhaps the user has provided a specific command to run in order to reproduce the error. I need to ask for clarification.

Wait, the PR description mentions "the linked stacktrace should make the issue obvious" and "the bug occurs because the field is an OrderBy object, not a string, during get_order_dir". It seems like there's a specific method or function where this error occurs.

Maybe I need to look into the Django code where ordering is handled, particularly in the query compiler or somewhere related to query construction.

Let me look for `get_order_dir` in the Django codebase.

================================================================================
RESPONSE:
Okay, so `get_order_dir` is used in `compiler.py`. Maybe I need to look into that function to see what's happening.

From the PR description, it seems that `get_order_dir` is receiving an `OrderBy` object instead of a string, which is causing the crash.

I need to understand what `get_order_dir` expects and why it's receiving an `OrderBy` object in this case.

Looking at the code, `get_order_dir` is defined in `query.py`, so I should check that.

================================================================================
RESPONSE:
So, `get_order_dir` expects a string representing the field name, possibly with a '-' prefix for descending order.

If it's receiving an `OrderBy` object instead, that's a problem because `get_order_dir` is trying to perform string operations on it.

I need to find where `get_order_dir` is being called with an `OrderBy` object.

Looking back at the `compiler.py` grep result:

- `self._meta_ordering = None`

- `ordering = self.query.extra_order_by`

- `ordering = self.query.order_by`

- `ordering = self.query.order_by`

- `ordering = self.query.get_meta().ordering`

- `self._meta_ordering = ordering`

- `ordering = []`

- `without_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql).group(1)`

- `without_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql).group(1)`

- `ordering = []`

It seems like `ordering` is being set from various sources, including `extra_order_by`, `order_by`, and `get_meta().ordering`.

I need to trace where `ordering` is being passed to `get_order_dir`.

Looking for `get_order_dir` calls in `compiler.py`:

<function=execute_bash>
<parameter=command>grep -r "get_order_dir" /workspace/django__django__3.0/django/db/models/sql/compiler.py</parameter>

================================================================================
RESPONSE:
So, in `compiler.py`, `get_order_dir` is being used in a couple of places.

Looking at the code, it seems like `get_order_dir` is being used to process the ordering fields.

I need to see where `ordering` is being set and make sure that it's a list of strings, not `OrderBy` objects.

Wait, perhaps `ordering` can contain `OrderBy` objects in some cases.

I need to understand how ordering is specified in `Meta.ordering`.

In Django, `Meta.ordering` typically accepts field names as strings or `F` expressions.

In Django 3.0, I need to check how `Meta.ordering` handles expressions.

Let me look up the Django 3.0 documentation for `Meta.ordering`.

I can't access the internet, but I can look for documentation in the repository.

Perhaps there's a `docs/` directory.

Model ``Meta`` options
======================

This document explains all the possible :ref:`metadata options
<meta-options>` that you can give your model in its internal
``class Meta``.

Available ``Meta`` options
==========================

.. currentmodule:: django.db.models

``abstract``
------------

.. attribute:: Options.abstract

    If ``abstract = True``, this model will be an
    :ref:`abstract base class <abstract-base-classes>`.

``app_label``
-------------

.. attribute:: Options.app_label

    If a model is defined outside of an application in
    :setting:`INSTALLED_APPS`, it must declare which app it belongs to::

        app_label = 'myapp'

    If you want to represent a model with the format ``app_label.object_name``
    or ``app_label.model_name`` you can use ``model._meta.label``
    or ``model._meta.label_lower`` respectively.

``base_manager_name``
---------------------

.. attribute:: Options.base_manager_name

    The name of the manager to use for the model's
    :attr:`~django.db.models.Model._base_manager`.

``db_table``
------------

.. attribute:: Options.db_table

    The name of the database table to use for the model::

        db_table = 'music_album'

.. _table-names:

Table names
~~~~~~~~~~~

To save you time, Django automatically derives the name of the database table
from the name of your model class and the app that contains it. A model's
database table name is constructed by joining the model's "app label" -- the
name you used in :djadmin:`manage.py startapp <startapp>` -- to the model's
class name, with an underscore between them.

For example, if you have an app ``bookstore`` (as created by
``manage.py startapp bookstore``), a model defined as ``class Book`` will have
a database table named ``bookstore_book``.

To override the database table name, use the ``db_table`` parameter in
``class Meta``.

If your database table name is an SQL reserved word, or contains characters that
aren't allowed in Python variable names -- notably, the hyphen -- that's OK.
Django quotes column and table names behind the scenes.

.. admonition:: Use lowercase table names for MariaDB and MySQL

    It is strongly advised that you use lowercase table names when you override
    the table name via ``db_table``, particularly if you are using the MySQL
    backend. See the :ref:`MySQL notes <mysql-notes>` for more details.

.. admonition:: Table name quoting for Oracle

   In order to meet the 30-char limitation Oracle has on table names,
   and match the usual conventions for Oracle databases, Django may shorten
   table names and turn them all-uppercase. To prevent such transformations,
   use a quoted name as the value for ``db_table``::

       db_table = '"name_left_in_lowercase"'

   Such quoted names can also be used with Django's other supported database
   backends; except for Oracle, however, the quotes have no effect. See the
   :ref:`Oracle notes <oracle-notes>` for more details.

``db_tablespace``
-----------------

.. attribute:: Options.db_tablespace

    The name of the :doc:`database tablespace </topics/db/tablespaces>` to use
    for this model. The default is the project's :setting:`DEFAULT_TABLESPACE`
    setting, if set. If the backend doesn't support tablespaces, this option is
    ignored.

``default_manager_name``
------------------------

.. attribute:: Options.default_manager_name

    The name of the manager to use for the model's
    :attr:`~django.db.models.Model._default_manager`.

``default_related_name``
------------------------

.. attribute:: Options.default_related_name

    The name that will be used by default for the relation from a related object
    back to this one. The default is ``<model_name>_set``.

    This option also sets :attr:`~ForeignKey.related_query_name`.

    As the reverse name for a field should be unique, be careful if you intend
    to subclass your model. To work around name collisions, part of the name
    should contain ``'%(app_label)s'`` and ``'%(model_name)s'``, which are
    replaced respectively by the name of the application the model is in,
    and the name of the model, both lowercased. See the paragraph on
    :ref:`related names for abstract models <abstract-related-name>`.

``get_latest_by``
-----------------

.. attribute:: Options.get_latest_by

    The name of a field or a list of field names in the model, typically
    :class:`DateField`, :class:`DateTimeField`, or :class:`IntegerField`. This
    specifies the default field(s) to use in your model :class:`Manager`’s
    :meth:`~django.db.models.query.QuerySet.latest` and
    :meth:`~django.db.models.query.QuerySet.earliest` methods.

    Example::

        # Latest by ascending order_date.
        get_latest_by = "order_date"

        # Latest by priority descending, order_date ascending.
        get_latest_by = ['-priority', 'order_date']

    See the :meth:`~django.db.models.query.QuerySet.latest` docs for more.

``managed``
-----------

.. attribute:: Options.managed

    Defaults to ``True``, meaning Django will create the appropriate database
    tables in :djadmin:`migrate` or as part of migrations and remove them as
    part of a :djadmin:`flush` management command. That is, Django
    *manages* the database tables' lifecycles.

    If ``False``, no database table creation or deletion operations will be
    performed for this model. This is useful if the model represents an existing
    table or a database view that has been created by some other means. This is
    the *only* difference when ``managed=False``. All other aspects of
    model handling are exactly the same as normal. This includes

    #. Adding an automatic primary key field to the model if you don't
       declare it.  To avoid confusion for later code readers, it's
       recommended to specify all the columns from the database table you
       are modeling when using unmanaged models.

    #. If a model with ``managed=False`` contains a
       :class:`~django.db.models.ManyToManyField` that points to another
       unmanaged model, then the intermediate table for the many-to-many
       join will also not be created. However, the intermediary table
       between one managed and one unmanaged model *will* be created.

       If you need to change this default behavior, create the intermediary
       table as an explicit model (with ``managed`` set as needed) and use
       the :attr:`ManyToManyField.through` attribute to make the relation
       use your custom model.

    For tests involving models with ``managed=False``, it's up to you to ensure
    the correct tables are created as part of the test setup.

    If you're interested in changing the Python-level behavior of a model class,
    you *could* use ``managed=False`` and create a copy of an existing model.
    However, there's a better approach for that situation: :ref:`proxy-models`.

``order_with_respect_to``
-------------------------

.. attribute:: Options.order_with_respect_to

    Makes this object orderable with respect to the given field, usually a
    ``ForeignKey``. This can be used to make related objects orderable with
    respect to a parent object. For example, if an ``Answer`` relates to a
    ``Question`` object, and a question has more than one answer, and the order
    of answers matters, you'd do this::

        from django.db import models

        class Question(models.Model):
            text = models.TextField()
            # ...

        class Answer(models.Model):
            question = models.ForeignKey(Question, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
            # ...

            class Meta:
                order_with_respect_to = 'question'

    When ``order_with_respect_to`` is set, two additional methods are provided to
    retrieve and to set the order of the related objects: ``get_RELATED_order()``
    and ``set_RELATED_order()``, where ``RELATED`` is the lowercased model name. For
    example, assuming that a ``Question`` object has multiple related ``Answer``
    objects, the list returned contains the primary keys of the related ``Answer``
    objects::

        >>> question = Question.objects.get(id=1)
        >>> question.get_answer_order()
        [1, 2, 3]

    The order of a ``Question`` object's related ``Answer`` objects can be set by
    passing in a list of ``Answer`` primary keys::

        >>> question.set_answer_order([3, 1, 2])

    The related objects also get two methods, ``get_next_in_order()`` and
    ``get_previous_in_order()``, which can be used to access those objects in their
    proper order. Assuming the ``Answer`` objects are ordered by ``id``::

        >>> answer = Answer.objects.get(id=2)
        >>> answer.get_next_in_order()
        <Answer: 3>
        >>> answer.get_previous_in_order()
        <Answer: 1>

.. admonition:: ``order_with_respect_to`` implicitly sets the ``ordering`` option

    Internally, ``order_with_respect_to`` adds an additional field/database
    column named ``_order`` and sets the model's :attr:`~Options.ordering`
    option to this field. Consequently, ``order_with_respect_to`` and
    ``ordering`` cannot be used together, and the ordering added by
    ``order_with_respect_to`` will apply whenever you obtain a list of objects
    of this model.

.. admonition:: Changing ``order_with_respect_to``

    Because ``order_with_respect_to`` adds a new database column, be sure to
    make and apply the appropriate migrations if you add or change
    ``order_with_respect_to`` after your initial :djadmin:`migrate`.

``ordering``
------------

.. attribute:: Options.ordering

    The default ordering for the object, for use when obtaining lists of objects::

        ordering = ['-order_date']

    This is a tuple or list of strings and/or query expressions. Each string is
    a field name with an optional "-" prefix, which indicates descending order.
    Fields without a leading "-" will be ordered ascending. Use the string "?"
    to order randomly.

    For example, to order by a ``pub_date`` field ascending, use this::

        ordering = ['pub_date']

    To order by ``pub_date`` descending, use this::

        ordering = ['-pub_date']

    To order by ``pub_date`` descending, then by ``author`` ascending, use this::

        ordering = ['-pub_date', 'author']

    You can also use :doc:`query expressions </ref/models/expressions>`. To
    order by ``author`` ascending and make null values sort last, use this::

        from django.db.models import F

        ordering = [F('author').asc(nulls_last=True)]

    Default ordering also affects :ref:`aggregation queries
    <aggregation-ordering-interaction>` but this won't be the case starting
    in Django 3.1.

.. warning::

    Ordering is not a free operation. Each field you add to the ordering
    incurs a cost to your database. Each foreign key you add will
    implicitly include all of its default orderings as well.

    If a query doesn't have an ordering specified, results are returned from
    the database in an unspecified order. A particular ordering is guaranteed
    only when ordering by a set of fields that uniquely identify each object in
    the results. For example, if a ``name`` field isn't unique, ordering by it
    won't guarantee objects with the same name always appear in the same order.

``permissions``
---------------

.. attribute:: Options.permissions

    Extra permissions to enter into the permissions table when creating this object.
    Add, change, delete, and view permissions are automatically created for each
    model. This example specifies an extra permission, ``can_deliver_pizzas``::

        permissions = [('can_deliver_pizzas', 'Can deliver pizzas')]

    This is a list or tuple of 2-tuples in the format ``(permission_code,
    human_readable_permission_name)``.

``default_permissions``
-----------------------

.. attribute:: Options.default_permissions

    Defaults to ``('add', 'change', 'delete', 'view')``. You may customize this
    list, for example, by setting this to an empty list if your app doesn't
    require any of the default permissions. It must be specified on the model
    before the model is created by :djadmin:`migrate` in order to prevent any
    omitted permissions from being created.

``proxy``
---------

.. attribute:: Options.proxy

    If ``proxy = True``, a model which subclasses another model will be treated as
    a :ref:`proxy model <proxy-models>`.

``required_db_features``
------------------------

.. attribute:: Options.required_db_features

    List of database features that the current connection should have so that
    the model is considered during the migration phase. For example, if you set
    this list to ``['gis_enabled']``, the model will only be synchronized on
    GIS-enabled databases. It's also useful to skip some models when testing
    with several database backends. Avoid relations between models that may or
    may not be created as the ORM doesn't handle this.

``required_db_vendor``
----------------------

.. attribute:: Options.required_db_vendor

    Name of a supported database vendor that this model is specific to. Current
    built-in vendor names are: ``sqlite``, ``postgresql``, ``mysql``,
    ``oracle``. If this attribute is not empty and the current connection vendor
    doesn't match it, the model will not be synchronized.

``select_on_save``
------------------

.. attribute:: Options.select_on_save

    Determines if Django will use the pre-1.6
    :meth:`django.db.models.Model.save()` algorithm. The old algorithm
    uses ``SELECT`` to determine if there is an existing row to be updated.
    The new algorithm tries an ``UPDATE`` directly. In some rare cases the
    ``UPDATE`` of an existing row isn't visible to Django. An example is the
    PostgreSQL ``ON UPDATE`` trigger which returns ``NULL``. In such cases the
    new algorithm will end up doing an ``INSERT`` even when a row exists in
    the database.

    Usually there is no need to set this attribute. The default is
    ``False``.

    See :meth:`django.db.models.Model.save()` for more about the old and
    new saving algorithm.

``indexes``
-----------

.. attribute:: Options.indexes

    A list of :doc:`indexes </ref/models/indexes>` that you want to define on
    the model::

        from django.db import models

        class Customer(models.Model):
            first_name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
            last_name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

            class Meta:
                indexes = [
                    models.Index(fields=['last_name', 'first_name']),
                    models.Index(fields=['first_name'], name='first_name_idx'),
                ]

``unique_together``
-------------------

.. attribute:: Options.unique_together

    .. admonition:: Use :class:`.UniqueConstraint` with the :attr:`~Options.constraints` option instead.

        :class:`.UniqueConstraint` provides more functionality than
        ``unique_together``. ``unique_together`` may be deprecated in the
        future.

    Sets of field names that, taken together, must be unique::

        unique_together = [['driver', 'restaurant']]

    This is a list of lists that must be unique when considered together.
    It's used in the Django admin and is enforced at the database level (i.e., the
    appropriate ``UNIQUE`` statements are included in the ``CREATE TABLE``
    statement).

    For convenience, ``unique_together`` can be a single list when dealing with
    a single set of fields::

        unique_together = ['driver', 'restaurant']

    A :class:`~django.db.models.ManyToManyField` cannot be included in
    unique_together. (It's not clear what that would even mean!) If you
    need to validate uniqueness related to a
    :class:`~django.db.models.ManyToManyField`, try using a signal or
    an explicit :attr:`through <ManyToManyField.through>` model.

    The ``ValidationError`` raised during model validation when the constraint
    is violated has the ``unique_together`` error code.

``index_together``
------------------

.. attribute:: Options.index_together

    .. admonition:: Use the :attr:`~Options.indexes` option instead.

        The newer :attr:`~Options.indexes` option provides more functionality
        than ``index_together``. ``index_together`` may be deprecated in the
        future.

    Sets of field names that, taken together, are indexed::

        index_together = [
            ["pub_date", "deadline"],
        ]

    This list of fields will be indexed together (i.e. the appropriate
    ``CREATE INDEX`` statement will be issued.)

    For convenience, ``index_together`` can be a single list when dealing with a single
    set of fields::

        index_together = ["pub_date", "deadline"]

``constraints``
---------------

.. attribute:: Options.constraints

    .. versionadded:: 2.2

    A list of :doc:`constraints </ref/models/constraints>` that you want to
    define on the model::

        from django.db import models

        class Customer(models.Model):
            age = models.IntegerField()

            class Meta:
                constraints = [
                    models.CheckConstraint(check=models.Q(age__gte=18), name='age_gte_18'),
                ]

``verbose_name``
----------------

.. attribute:: Options.verbose_name

    A human-readable name for the object, singular::

        verbose_name = "pizza"

    If this isn't given, Django will use a munged version of the class name:
    ``CamelCase`` becomes ``camel case``.

``verbose_name_plural``
-----------------------

.. attribute:: Options.verbose_name_plural

    The plural name for the object::

        verbose_name_plural = "stories"

    If this isn't given, Django will use :attr:`~Options.verbose_name` + ``"s"``.

Read-only ``Meta`` attributes
=============================

``label``
---------

.. attribute:: Options.label

    Representation of the object, returns ``app_label.object_name``, e.g.
    ``'polls.Question'``.

``label_lower``
---------------

.. attribute:: Options.label_lower

    Representation of the model, returns ``app_label.model_name``, e.g.
    ``'polls.question'``.

RESPONSE:
Okay, so from the documentation, `Meta.ordering` can accept a list of strings or query expressions. So, it's possible to use expressions in `Meta.ordering`.

Given that, I need to find where in the codebase `Meta.ordering` is set to an expression, and see how that's being handled during query construction, especially in the context of multi-table inheritance.

I need to find a model where `Meta.ordering` is set to an expression.

Let me search for `ordering =` in model class definitions.

I can use `grep` to search for `ordering =` in Python files.

================================================================================
RESPONSE:
Still, this doesn't show me where `Meta.ordering` is set to an expression.

Maybe I need to look for models in the Django codebase that use expressions in `Meta.ordering`.

Alternatively, perhaps the user has provided a specific model or code snippet that demonstrates the issue.

I need to think differently. Maybe I should look for tests that fail due to this issue.

Let me check the test results.

I need to run the tests to see which one is failing.

RESPONSE:
Okay, so running the tests gives me a bunch of failures and skips. There are 7 failures and 915 skips.

I need to narrow down to the specific test that's related to the PR description.

The PR description mentions "order_by() a parent model crash when Meta.ordering contains expressions."

I need to find a test that involves ordering with expressions in a multi-table inheritance scenario.

Looking back at the test output, there are many tests, and it's not immediately clear which one is relevant.

Maybe I should look for tests in the `model_inheritance` directory.

Let me check the `model_inheritance` tests.

RESPONSE:
So, there's a `tests.py` file in `model_inheritance`. Maybe the relevant test is in there.

Let me check the contents of `tests.py`:

LAST RESPONSE:
I don't see any tests in `model_inheritance/tests.py` that specifically deal with ordering with expressions.

Maybe the test is in another file, like `ordering.py` or something similar.

Let me look for a test file that mentions ordering and expressions.

<function=execute_bash>
<parameter=command>grep -r "ordering" /workspace/django__django__3.0/tests/</parameter>
