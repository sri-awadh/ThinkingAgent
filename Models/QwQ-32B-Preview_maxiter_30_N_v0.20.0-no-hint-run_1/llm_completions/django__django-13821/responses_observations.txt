INITIAL ISSUE:
################################################################################
You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.
<IMPORTANT>
* If user provides a path, you should NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. Instead, you should explore the file system to find the file before working on it.
* When configuring git credentials, use "openhands" as the user.name and "openhands@all-hands.dev" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
* The assistant MUST NOT include comments in the code unless they are necessary to describe non-obvious behavior.
</IMPORTANT>
You have access to the following functions:

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #1: execute_bash ----
Description: Execute a bash command in the terminal.
* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, it should be run in the background and the output should be redirected to a file, e.g. command = `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`.
* Interactive: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. The assistant must then send a second call to terminal with an empty `command` (which will retrieve any additional logs), or it can send additional text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process, or it can send command like `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the process.

Parameters:
  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty string to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the currently running process.
---- END FUNCTION #1 ----

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: finish ----
Description: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.
No parameters are required for this function.
---- END FUNCTION #2 ----

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----
Description: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files
* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user
* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep
* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file
* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`
* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`

Notes for using the `str_replace` command:
* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!
* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique
* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`

Parameters:
  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.
Allowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]
  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/workspace/file.py` or `/workspace`.
  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.
  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.
  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.
  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.
  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.
---- END FUNCTION #3 ----


If you choose to call a function ONLY reply in the following format with NO suffix:

<function=example_function_name>
<parameter=example_parameter_1>value_1</parameter>
<parameter=example_parameter_2>
This is the value for the second parameter
that can span
multiple lines
</parameter>
</function>

<IMPORTANT>
Reminder:
- Function calls MUST follow the specified format, start with <function= and end with </function>
- Required parameters MUST be specified
- Only call one function at a time
- You may provide optional reasoning for your function call in natural language BEFORE the function call, but NOT after.
- If there is no function call available, answer the question like normal with your current knowledge and do not tell the user about function calls

--------------------- NEW TASK DESCRIPTION ---------------------
<uploaded_files>
/workspace/django__django__3.2
</uploaded_files>
I've uploaded a python code repository in the directory django__django__3.2. Consider the following PR description:

<pr_description>
Drop support for SQLite < 3.9.0
Description
	 
		(last modified by Tim Graham)
	 
Indexes on expressions (see #26167) and the SQLITE_ENABLE_JSON1 compile-time option are supported on ​SQLite 3.9.0+.
Ubuntu Xenial ships with SQLite 3.11.0 (which will still by supported by Django) and will EOL in April 2021. Debian Jessie ships with 3.8.7 and was EOL June 30, 2020.
SQLite 3.9.0 was released in October 2015. SQLite version support seems like a similar situation as GEOS libraries which we generally support about 5 years after released.

</pr_description>

Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?
I've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!
Your task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /workspace directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.
Follow these steps to resolve the issue:
1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.
2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error
3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue
4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!
5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well
Your thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.

PLEASE follow the format strictly! PLEASE EMIT ONE AND ONLY ONE FUNCTION CALL PER MESSAGE.

################################################################################


================================================================================
RESPONSE:
Alright, I've got this task to update a Django repository to drop support for SQLite versions older than 3.9.0. The PR description mentions that indexes on expressions and the SQLITE_ENABLE_JSON1 option are supported on SQLite 3.9.0 and above. It also provides some background on when different Ubuntu and Debian versions ship with certain SQLite versions and their end-of-life dates.

First things first, I need to understand what this means in terms of code changes. Since the description says that test files have already been taken care of, I don't need to worry about modifying any tests. My focus should be on making minimal changes to non-test files in the repository to ensure that Django no longer supports SQLite versions older than 3.9.0.

I should start by exploring the repository structure to get a sense of where the relevant code might be. The repository is located in /workspace/django__django__3.2. I need to navigate to this directory and list its contents to see what's inside.

So, my first step is to use the execute_bash function to change directory to /workspace/django__django__3.2 and list its contents.

<function=execute_bash>
<parameter=command>
cd /workspace/django__django__3.2 && ls
</parameter>

[Command finished with exit code 0]

================================================================================
RESPONSE:
Okay, so the repository contains various files and directories, including django/, docs/, tests/, etc. Since I need to make changes to non-test files, I should focus on files outside of the tests directory.

The PR description mentions that indexes on expressions and the SQLITE_ENABLE_JSON1 option are supported on SQLite 3.9.0 and above. This suggests that there might be code in Django that handles these features conditionally based on the SQLite version.

I need to find where Django checks the SQLite version and possibly update those checks to require at least version 3.9.0.

First, I should look into the database backend for SQLite in Django. Django has a database backend for SQLite located in django/db/backends/sqlite3/.

I should navigate to that directory and look for files that handle version checks or feature support.

<function=execute_bash>
<parameter=command>ls /workspace/django__django__3.2/django/db/backends/sqlite3</parameter>


---------------------------------------- OBSERVATION ----------------------------------------
EXECUTION RESULT of [execute_bash]:
__init__.py  base.py  client.py  creation.py  features.py  introspection.py  operations.py  schema.py
[Python Interpreter: /opt/miniconda3/envs/testbed/bin/python]
[Command finished with exit code 0]

================================================================================
RESPONSE:
Alright, so in django/db/backends/sqlite3/, there are several files that might be relevant:

- base.py: This is likely the main backend module for SQLite.

- creation.py: Handles creation of test databases and other setup.

- features.py: Defines database features supported by SQLite.

- operations.py: Defines database operations supported by SQLite.

Given that the PR is about dropping support for SQLite versions older than 3.9.0, I should look into where Django checks the SQLite version and possibly updates the minimum required version.

First, I'll look into base.py to see where the SQLite version is being checked.

I can use the str_replace_editor function to view the content of base.py.

RESPONSE:
Okay, so in base.py, there's a function called check_sqlite_version() that checks if the SQLite version is at least 3.8.3. The PR is about dropping support for SQLite versions older than 3.9.0, so I need to update this version check.

Looking at lines 66-71:

66	def check_sqlite_version():

67	    if Database.sqlite_version_info < (3, 8, 3):

68	        raise ImproperlyConfigured('SQLite 3.8.3 or later is required (found %s).' % Database.sqlite_version)

69	

70	check_sqlite_version()

So, it seems like the version check is done here, and it's currently set to require at least 3.8.3. I need to change this to require at least 3.9.0.

I should update the version tuple from (3, 8, 3) to (3, 9, 0). Also, the error message should reflect the new required version.

So, the updated code should look like this:

def check_sqlite_version():

    if Database.sqlite_version_info < (3, 9, 0):

        raise ImproperlyConfigured('SQLite 3.9.0 or later is required (found %s).' % Database.sqlite_version)

check_sqlite_version()

I need to make sure that this is the only place where the SQLite version is checked. Let me search the file for other occurrences of sqlite_version.

I can use the str_replace_editor function with the command 'view' to search for 'sqlite_version' in base.py.

<function=str_replace_editor>

<parameter=command>view</parameter>

RESPONSE:
Looking through the rest of the file, I don't see any other references to sqlite_version. So, updating the version check in check_sqlite_version() should suffice.

But, I should also consider if there are any features or operations in Django that are conditionally enabled based on the SQLite version. The PR description mentions that indexes on expressions and the SQLITE_ENABLE_JSON1 option are supported on SQLite 3.9.0 and above.

I need to ensure that Django doesn't attempt to use these features on older SQLite versions. Since we're dropping support for SQLite < 3.9.0, we can assume that these features are always available.

I should check if there are any version checks for these features and remove or update them accordingly.

First, let's look for any conditional code that enables or uses indexes on expressions or the JSON1 extension.

I can search the base.py file for keywords like "expression index", "JSON1", or similar.

I'll use the str_replace_editor function again to search for these terms.

RESPONSE:
Looking through the file, I don't see any explicit checks for the JSON1 extension or expression indexes. However, in the data_types dictionary, there's a 'JSONField' mapping to 'text'. I need to ensure that JSONField is handled correctly for SQLite versions >= 3.9.0.

I should check if there's any code that enables the JSON1 extension. According to the SQLite documentation, the JSON1 extension needs to be enabled at compile-time with the SQLITE_ENABLE_JSON1 option.

Since we're dropping support for SQLite < 3.9.0, and assuming that the JSON1 extension is enabled in the SQLite builds we support, we might not need to do anything special here.

But to be safe, I should confirm if Django explicitly enables the JSON1 extension.

Looking back at base.py, in the get_new_connection method, there's a line:

conn.execute('PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON')

I don't see any pragma related to the JSON1 extension, so perhaps it's assumed to be enabled if the SQLite version is >= 3.9.0.

I should check the documentation or the release notes to confirm when the JSON1 extension was introduced and if it's enabled by default in the versions we support.

Alternatively, I can look for any code that uses JSON1 functions and ensure that they are only used if the SQLite version is >= 3.9.0.

But since we're dropping support for SQLite < 3.9.0, and assuming that the JSON1 extension is available in SQLite 3.9.0 and above, I can proceed without adding version checks for JSON1 functions.

Next, I need to consider indexes on expressions. According to the PR description, indexes on expressions are supported on SQLite 3.9.0 and above.

I need to ensure that Django doesn't try to create indexes on expressions for older SQLite versions.

Looking in the schema.py file, which is located in django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py, I should check how indexes are handled.

First, I need to navigate to that file and view its content.

LAST RESPONSE:
Looking through schema.py, I don't see any explicit handling of expression indexes. Maybe expression indexes are handled at a higher level in Django's ORM.

I should check the operations.py file, which is located in django/db/backends/sqlite3/operations.py, to see how indexes are created.

First, I need to navigate to that file and view its content.
