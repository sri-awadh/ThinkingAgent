Consider the following issue description:\n\n<issue_description>\nNitpick flags Literal annotation values as missing py:class\n### Describe the bug\n\nWhen a value is present in a type annotation as `Literal`, sphinx will treat the value as a `py:class`. With nitpick enabled, values like `Literal[True]` end up failing, because `True` is not a class.\r\n\r\nThis is a problem for builds which want to use `-n -W` to catch doc errors.\n\n### How to Reproduce\n\nSetup a simple function which uses Literal, then attempt to autodoc it. e.g.\r\n```python\r\nimport typing\r\n@typing.overload\r\ndef foo(x: \"typing.Literal[True]\") -> int: ...\r\n@typing.overload\r\ndef foo(x: \"typing.Literal[False]\") -> str: ...\r\ndef foo(x: bool):\r\n    \"\"\"a func\"\"\"\r\n    return 1 if x else \"foo\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've pushed an example [failing project](https://github.com/sirosen/repro/tree/master/sphinxdoc/literal) to [my repro repo](https://github.com/sirosen/repro). Just run `./doc.sh` with `sphinx-build` available to see the failing build.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n`Literal[True]` (or whatever literal value) should be present in the type annotation but should not trigger the nitpick warning.\n\n### Your project\n\nhttps://github.com/sirosen/repro/tree/master/sphinxdoc/literal\n\n### Screenshots\n\n_No response_\n\n### OS\n\nLinux\n\n### Python version\n\n3.8, 3.9\n\n### Sphinx version\n\n4.1.2\n\n### Sphinx extensions\n\nautodoc\n\n### Extra tools\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n</issue_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <issue_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /workspace directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.\n\n--------------------- END OF NEW TASK DESCRIPTION --------------------- \n\nREASON AS MUCH AS NEEDED, BUT RESPECT THE FORMAT STRICTLY! AFTER REASONING, EMIT ONE AND ONLY ONE FUNCTION CALL PER MESSAGE.\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, let's tackle this issue. So, the problem is that when using Literal type annotations with values like True or False, Sphinx's nitpick feature flags them as missing py:class references. This causes errors in the build when nitpick is enabled. The goal is to modify the Sphinx codebase to handle these Literal annotations correctly so that they don't trigger nitpick warnings.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how Sphinx processes type annotations, especially Literal types. From what I can gather, when Sphinx encounters a type annotation like `Literal[True]`, it might be treating the `True` as a class reference, which doesn't exist, hence the nitpick error.\n\nThe steps I need to take are:\n\n1. **Explore the repository structure**: I should first look into the codebase to find where type parsing happens. Since this is related to autodoc and type annotations, the relevant parts are probably in the autodoc extension.\n\n2. **Reproduce the error**: I need to create a script that uses the current codebase to process the example function and see the nitpick error. This will help verify that the issue exists and that my changes fix it.\n\n3. **Identify the code responsible for parsing Literal types**: Once I find where Literal types are being parsed, I can adjust the code to handle the values correctly, so they aren't treated as class references.\n\n4. **Test the fix**: After making the changes, I need to run the reproduce script again to ensure the error is gone.\n\nLet me start by exploring the repository structure. The uploaded directory is `sphinx-doc__sphinx__4.2`, which I assume is the Sphinx codebase at version 4.2. I need to find the relevant files for autodoc and type parsing.\n\nI'll start by checking the `sphinx/ext/autodoc` directory, as that's where the autodoc extension is located. Within that, there might be files handling type parsing, such as `type_comment.py` or similar.\n\nAlternatively, the parsing of type annotations could be handled in the `sphinx/util/inspect.py` or `sphinx/domains/python.py` files. I need to look for code that processes type hints and specifically handles the Literal type.\n\nOnce I find the relevant code, I can look for how Literal types are being parsed and represented. The issue seems to be that the values inside Literal (like True, False) are being treated as class names, which they aren't. So, the code probably needs to be adjusted to recognize that these are not classes and thus not trigger the nitpick warning.\n\nAnother approach is to check if there's a way to configure Sphinx to ignore certain types or to mark them as non-classes. But since the problem is with the Literal type specifically, modifying the code to handle Literal values correctly is probably the right path.\n\nLet me start by looking for the code that processes type annotations in the autodoc extension. I'll use the str_replace_editor function to browse the files.\n\nFirst, I need to find the file that handles type parsing. Let's see. The autodoc extension has a module called `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py`, but I'm not sure. Maybe there's a specific file for type handling.\n\nAlternatively, the `sphinx/ext/autodoc/annotation.py` file might be involved. Let me check.\n\nWait, perhaps the code that converts type hints into ReST directives is in the `sphinx/domains/python.py` file. Let me look there.\n\nAlternatively, the `sphinx/util/inspect.py` file has functions like `signature()` which might be involved in parsing the type hints.\n\nThis is a bit of a guess, but I need to find where the Literal type is being processed. Let's try to find references to 'Literal' in the codebase.\n\nI can use the str_replace_editor function to search for 'Literal' in the codebase.

Consider the following issue description:\n\n<issue_description>\nNitpick flags Literal annotation values as missing py:class\n### Describe the bug\n\nWhen a value is present in a type annotation as `Literal`, sphinx will treat the value as a `py:class`. With nitpick enabled, values like `Literal[True]` end up failing, because `True` is not a class.\r\n\r\nThis is a problem for builds which want to use `-n -W` to catch doc errors.\n\n### How to Reproduce\n\nSetup a simple function which uses Literal, then attempt to autodoc it. e.g.\r\n```python\r\nimport typing\r\n@typing.overload\r\ndef foo(x: \"typing.Literal[True]\") -> int: ...\r\n@typing.overload\r\ndef foo(x: \"typing.Literal[False]\") -> str: ...\r\ndef foo(x: bool):\r\n    \"\"\"a func\"\"\"\r\n    return 1 if x else \"foo\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've pushed an example [failing project](https://github.com/sirosen/repro/tree/master/sphinxdoc/literal) to [my repro repo](https://github.com/sirosen/repro). Just run `./doc.sh` with `sphinx-build` available to see the failing build.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n`Literal[True]` (or whatever literal value) should be present in the type annotation but should not trigger the nitpick warning.\n\n### Your project\n\nhttps://github.com/sirosen/repro/tree/master/sphinxdoc/literal\n\n### Screenshots\n\n_No response_\n\n### OS\n\nLinux\n\n### Python version\n\n3.8, 3.9\n\n### Sphinx version\n\n4.1.2\n\n### Sphinx extensions\n\nautodoc\n\n### Extra tools\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n</issue_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <issue_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /workspace directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.\n", "role": "user"}, {"content": "Okay, let's tackle this issue. So, the problem is that when using Literal type annotations with values like True or False, Sphinx's nitpick feature flags them as missing py:class references. This causes errors in the build when nitpick is enabled. The goal is to modify the Sphinx codebase to handle these Literal annotations correctly so that they don't trigger nitpick warnings.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how Sphinx processes type annotations, especially Literal types. From what I can gather, when Sphinx encounters a type annotation like `Literal[True]`, it might be treating the `True` as a class reference, which doesn't exist, hence the nitpick error.\n\nThe steps I need to take are:\n\n1. **Explore the repository structure**: I should first look into the codebase to find where type parsing happens. Since this is related to autodoc and type annotations, the relevant parts are probably in the autodoc extension.\n\n2. **Reproduce the error**: I need to create a script that uses the current codebase to process the example function and see the nitpick error. This will help verify that the issue exists and that my changes fix it.\n\n3. **Identify the code responsible for parsing Literal types**: Once I find where Literal types are being parsed, I can adjust the code to handle the values correctly, so they aren't treated as class references.\n\n4. **Test the fix**: After making the changes, I need to run the reproduce script again to ensure the error is gone.\n\nLet me start by exploring the repository structure. The uploaded directory is `sphinx-doc__sphinx__4.2`, which I assume is the Sphinx codebase at version 4.2. I need to find the relevant files for autodoc and type parsing.\n\nI'll start by checking the `sphinx/ext/autodoc` directory, as that's where the autodoc extension is located. Within that, there might be files handling type parsing, such as `type_comment.py` or similar.\n\nAlternatively, the parsing of type annotations could be handled in the `sphinx/util/inspect.py` or `sphinx/domains/python.py` files. I need to look for code that processes type hints and specifically handles the Literal type.\n\nOnce I find the relevant code, I can look for how Literal types are being parsed and represented. The issue seems to be that the values inside Literal (like True, False) are being treated as class names, which they aren't. So, the code probably needs to be adjusted to recognize that these are not classes and thus not trigger the nitpick warning.\n\nAnother approach is to check if there's a way to configure Sphinx to ignore certain types or to mark them as non-classes. But since the problem is with the Literal type specifically, modifying the code to handle Literal values correctly is probably the right path.\n\nLet me start by looking for the code that processes type annotations in the autodoc extension. I'll use the str_replace_editor function to browse the files.\n\nFirst, I need to find the file that handles type parsing. Let's see. The autodoc extension has a module called `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py`, but I'm not sure. Maybe there's a specific file for type handling.\n\nAlternatively, the `sphinx/ext/autodoc/annotation.py` file might be involved. Let me check.\n\nWait, perhaps the code that converts type hints into ReST directives is in the `sphinx/domains/python.py` file. Let me look there.\n\nAlternatively, the `sphinx/util/inspect.py` file has functions like `signature()` which might be involved in parsing the type hints.\n\nThis is a bit of a guess, but I need to find where the Literal type is being processed. Let's try to find references to 'Literal' in the codebase.\n\nI can use the str_replace_editor function to search for 'Literal' in the codebase.
