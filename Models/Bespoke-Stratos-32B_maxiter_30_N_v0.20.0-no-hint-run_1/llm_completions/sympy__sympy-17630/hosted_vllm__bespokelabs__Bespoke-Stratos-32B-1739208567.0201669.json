AFTER REASONING, EMIT ONE AND ONLY ONE FUNCTION CALL PER MESSAGE.\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, let's tackle this issue. So, the problem is that when multiplying a BlockMatrix containing ZeroMatrix blocks multiple times, it throws an exception. The error occurs because after the first multiplication, the ZeroMatrix blocks are being replaced with Zero objects, which don't have the 'cols' attribute. That's causing the AttributeError when trying to access cols.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the SymPy repository. The uploaded directory is sympy__sympy__1.5, which is probably the SymPy codebase at version 1.5. The issue is related to the BlockMatrix and ZeroMatrix classes in the matrices module.\n\nThe error happens when multiplying the BlockMatrix three times. The first two multiplications work, but the third causes an exception. The problem seems to be that after the first multiplication, the ZeroMatrix blocks are being converted to Zero objects, which don't have the necessary attributes for further operations.\n\nSo, the key is to ensure that when a ZeroMatrix is involved in block multiplication, it remains a ZeroMatrix or is properly handled so that it has the required attributes like 'cols'.\n\nLet me start by exploring the repository structure. The BlockMatrix and ZeroMatrix classes are likely in the matrices/expressions directory. I should look into the blockmatrix.py file and see how ZeroMatrix is being handled during multiplication.\n\nFirst, I need to create a script that reproduces the error. Then, I can run it to confirm the issue. After that, I'll look into the code to find where the ZeroMatrix is being replaced with Zero and fix that.\n\nLet me start by creating a Python script that reproduces the error. I'll call it reproduce_error.py.\n\nThe script will contain the code from the issue description:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\na = MatrixSymbol(\"a\", 2, 2)\nz = ZeroMatrix(2, 2)\nb = BlockMatrix([[a, z], [z, z]])\nprint(block_collapse(b * b))  # This should work\nprint(block_collapse(b * b * b))  # This should throw an exception\n```\n\nI'll save this script and run it using the BashTool to see the error.\n\nOnce I confirm the error, I need to find where in the code the ZeroMatrix is being replaced with Zero. Looking at the error traceback, it seems that during the block multiplication, the ZeroMatrix is being converted to a Zero object, which doesn't have the 'cols' attribute.\n\nIn the blockmatrix.py file, the _blockmul method is where the multiplication happens. Let me check that method.\n\nLooking at the code for BlockMatrix._blockmul, it's possible that when multiplying blocks, if a block is a ZeroMatrix, it's being simplified to a Zero object. But why does this happen only after the first multiplication?\n\nAlternatively, maybe during the block multiplication, the ZeroMatrix is being treated as a scalar zero, leading to the replacement with a Zero object. But that's not correct because ZeroMatrix is a matrix, not a scalar.\n\nSo, the problem is that during the multiplication, the ZeroMatrix is being incorrectly replaced with a scalar zero, which doesn't have the necessary matrix attributes.\n\nTo fix this, we need to ensure that when a ZeroMatrix is involved in block multiplication, it remains a ZeroMatrix or is handled in a way that preserves its matrix structure.\n\nLet me look into the code for BlockMatrix._blockmul. The method is responsible for multiplying two BlockMatrix instances. It likely checks the block sizes and performs element-wise multiplication.\n\nIn the code, when multiplying two blocks, if one of them is a ZeroMatrix, the result should be a ZeroMatrix of appropriate size. However, it seems that in this case, the ZeroMatrix is being replaced with a scalar zero, leading to the error.\n\nSo, the fix would involve ensuring that when multiplying a ZeroMatrix with another matrix, the result is a ZeroMatrix of the correct size, rather than a scalar zero.\n\nLet me check the code for BlockMatrix._blockmul. The method probably has logic to handle multiplication of blocks, including ZeroMatrix blocks. There might be a condition where if a block is a ZeroMatrix, it's treated as a zero scalar, which is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ZeroMatrix is being simplified to a Zero object during some simplification step, which is then used in the block multiplication.\n\nTo find the exact cause, I need to look into the code where the ZeroMatrix is being replaced with Zero. Let's see.\n\nIn the error traceback, the exception occurs in the colblocksizes method of BlockMatrix. The code is trying to access self.blocks[0, i].cols, but self.blocks[0, i] is a Zero object, which doesn't have the 'cols' attribute.\n\nSo, the ZeroMatrix in the blocks is being replaced with a Zero object, which is causing the problem.\n\nLooking at the code for BlockMatrix, the blocks are stored in a matrix-like structure. When multiplying, the blocks are multiplied element-wise, and if a block is a ZeroMatrix, the result should be a ZeroMatrix of the appropriate size.\n\nBut in this case, it seems that during the multiplication, the ZeroMatrix is being replaced with a Zero object, which is a scalar, leading to the error.\n\nSo, the fix is to ensure that when multiplying a ZeroMatrix with another matrix, the result is a ZeroMatrix, not a scalar zero.\n\nTo do this, I need to find where in the code the ZeroMatrix is being replaced with Zero and prevent that from happening.\n\nLooking at the code for BlockMatrix._blockmul, perhaps there's a condition that checks if a block is a zero matrix and replaces it with a scalar zero. That would be incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe during the simplification of the block multiplication, the ZeroMatrix is being simplified to a Zero object.\n\nLet me check the code for BlockMatrix._blockmul. The method is part of the BlockMatrix class, and it's responsible for multiplying two BlockMatrix instances.\n\nIn the code, the _blockmul method likely checks the block sizes and performs element-wise multiplication. If a block is a ZeroMatrix, the result of multiplying it with another block should be a ZeroMatrix of the appropriate size.\n\nBut perhaps there's a condition where if a block is a ZeroMatrix, it's being treated as a scalar zero, leading to the replacement with a Zero object.\n\nTo fix this, I need to ensure that when a ZeroMatrix is involved in the multiplication, it's treated as a matrix, not a scalar.\n\nLooking at the code for BlockMatrix._blockmul, perhaps there's a line where it checks if a block is zero and replaces it with a scalar zero. That would be the issue.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ZeroMatrix is being simplified to a Zero object during some other step, like when the block is being processed for multiplication.\n\nTo find the exact location, I need to look into the code.\n\nLet me first check the blockmatrix.py file in the repository.

The _blockmul method is defined in lines 164-170. Let me check that part again.\n\nThe _blockmul method is part of the BlockMatrix class. It checks if the other matrix is also a BlockMatrix and if the column block sizes of the current matrix match the row block sizes of the other matrix. If so, it multiplies the blocks using matrix multiplication (blocks*other.blocks) and returns a new BlockMatrix. Otherwise, it returns the product of the two matrices as a regular MatMul expression.\n\nBut in the case of the issue, when multiplying the BlockMatrix three times, the first multiplication works, but the second multiplication converts the ZeroMatrix blocks into Zero objects, leading to the error.\n\nLooking at the code, when multiplying two BlockMatrix instances, the blocks are multiplied element-wise. However, if a block is a ZeroMatrix, multiplying it with another block should result in a ZeroMatrix of the appropriate size. But in this case, it seems that the ZeroMatrix is being replaced with a scalar zero, which is causing the problem.\n\nSo, the issue is likely in how the blocks are being multiplied. When a ZeroMatrix is multiplied by another matrix, the result should be a ZeroMatrix, but instead, it's being treated as a scalar zero.\n\nTo fix this, I need to ensure that when a ZeroMatrix is involved in the multiplication, it's handled correctly and not replaced with a scalar zero.\n\nLooking at the code for BlockMatrix._blockmul, the line 167 is:\n\nreturn BlockMatrix(self.blocks*other.blocks)\n\nThis uses matrix multiplication of the blocks. However, when multiplying two matrices, if one of them is a ZeroMatrix, the result should be a ZeroMatrix of the appropriate size. But perhaps the current implementation is not handling this case correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ZeroMatrix is being simplified to a Zero object during the multiplication.\n\nTo find out, I need to look into how the blocks are being multiplied. The self.blocks and other.blocks are instances of ImmutableDenseMatrix, which is a matrix of matrices. When multiplying these, the * operator is used, which performs matrix multiplication.\n\nBut when multiplying a ZeroMatrix with another matrix, the result should be a ZeroMatrix. However, if the ZeroMatrix is being treated as a scalar zero, the multiplication would result in a scalar zero, which is incorrect.\n\nSo, the problem is that during the multiplication of the blocks, the ZeroMatrix is being treated as a scalar zero, leading to the replacement with a Zero object.\n\nTo fix this, I need to ensure that when multiplying a ZeroMatrix with another matrix, the result is a ZeroMatrix of the appropriate size.\n\nLooking into the code for ImmutableDenseMatrix multiplication, perhaps there's a condition that checks if a block is a zero matrix and replaces it with a scalar zero. That would be the issue.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ZeroMatrix is being simplified to a Zero object during the multiplication.\n\nTo find the exact location, I need to look into the code for ImmutableDenseMatrix multiplication.\n\nBut since the code for ImmutableDenseMatrix is part of the sympy.matrices.immutable module, which is not in the same file, I need to check that code.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is in the way the blocks are being multiplied. For example, when multiplying two blocks, if one of them is a ZeroMatrix, the result should be a ZeroMatrix of the appropriate size.\n\nBut in the current code, the blocks are multiplied using the * operator, which may not handle ZeroMatrix correctly.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to modify the _blockmul method to handle ZeroMatrix blocks explicitly.\n\nLet me think. When multiplying two blocks, if either block is a ZeroMatrix, the result should be a ZeroMatrix of the appropriate size. For example, if A is a ZeroMatrix of size (m x n) and B is a matrix of size (n x p), then the product should be a ZeroMatrix of size (m x p).\n\nBut in the current code, when multiplying the blocks, the * operator is used, which may not handle this case correctly.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to replace the line:\n\nreturn BlockMatrix(self.blocks*other.blocks)\n\nwith code that explicitly checks for ZeroMatrix blocks and handles them correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the ZeroMatrix is being simplified to a Zero object during the multiplication.\n\nTo confirm this, I can look into the code for the * operator on MatrixExpr.\n\nBut since this is a complex issue, perhaps the best approach is to modify the _blockmul method to handle ZeroMatrix blocks explicitly.\n\nLet me try to modify the _blockmul method to check if either block is a ZeroMatrix and handle it accordingly.\n\nFor example, in the _blockmul method, when multiplying two blocks, if either block is a ZeroMatrix, the result should be a ZeroMatrix of the appropriate size.\n\nSo, in the code for BlockMatrix._blockmul, after checking that the block sizes are compatible, we can iterate through each block and handle ZeroMatrix cases.\n\nBut how is the multiplication of the blocks handled? The current code uses self.blocks*other.blocks, which is matrix multiplication of the blocks.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is that when multiplying a ZeroMatrix with another matrix, the result is a scalar zero instead of a ZeroMatrix.\n\nTo fix this, we need to ensure that when multiplying a ZeroMatrix with another matrix, the result is a ZeroMatrix of the appropriate size.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to replace the line:\n\nreturn BlockMatrix(self.blocks*other.blocks)\n\nwith code that iterates through each block and handles ZeroMatrix cases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is in the way the blocks are being multiplied. For example, when multiplying two blocks, if one is a ZeroMatrix, the result should be a ZeroMatrix of the appropriate size.\n\nBut in the current code, the blocks are multiplied using the * operator, which may not handle this case correctly.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to replace the line:\n\nreturn BlockMatrix(self.blocks*other.blocks)\n\nwith code that explicitly checks for ZeroMatrix blocks and handles them.\n\nLet me try to modify the _blockmul method to handle ZeroMatrix blocks.\n\nHere's the current code for _blockmul:\n\n    def _blockmul(self, other):\n        if (isinstance(other, BlockMatrix) and\n                self.colblocksizes == other.rowblocksizes):\n            return BlockMatrix(self.blocks*other.blocks)\n        return self * other\n\nThe problem is that when multiplying self.blocks and other.blocks, the * operator is used, which may not handle ZeroMatrix correctly.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to replace the line:\n\nreturn BlockMatrix(self.blocks*other.blocks)\n\nwith code that iterates through each block and handles ZeroMatrix cases.\n\nFor example:\n\n        # Create a new matrix to hold the result blocks\n        result_blocks = []\n        for i in range(self.blocks.rows):\n            row = []\n            for j in range(other.blocks.cols):\n                # Compute the product of the i-th row of self.blocks and j-th column of other.blocks\n                total = ZeroMatrix(self.rowblocksizes[i], other.colblocksizes[j])\n                for k in range(self.blocks.cols):\n                    a = self.blocks[i, k]\n                    b = other.blocks[k, j]\n                    # Handle ZeroMatrix cases\n                    if isinstance(a, ZeroMatrix) or isinstance(b, ZeroMatrix):\n                        # The product is a ZeroMatrix of size (a.rows x b.cols)\n                        product = ZeroMatrix(a.rows, b.cols)\n                    else:\n                        product = a * b\n                    total += product\n                row.append(total)\n            result_blocks.append(row)\n        return BlockMatrix(result_blocks)\n\nBut this approach would require iterating through each block and handling the multiplication manually, which could be computationally expensive but ensures that ZeroMatrix blocks are handled correctly.\n\nHowever, this approach may not be efficient, but it's necessary to handle the ZeroMatrix cases correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the ZeroMatrix is being simplified to a Zero object during the multiplication. So, perhaps the fix is to prevent the simplification of ZeroMatrix to Zero.\n\nLooking at the code for ZeroMatrix, perhaps during the multiplication, the ZeroMatrix is being replaced with a Zero object.\n\nTo find out, I need to look into the code for ZeroMatrix and see how it's handled during multiplication.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the ZeroMatrix is being treated as a scalar zero during the multiplication.\n\nIn any case, the fix is to ensure that when a ZeroMatrix is multiplied by another matrix, the result is a ZeroMatrix of the appropriate size, not a scalar zero.\n\nSo, the solution is to modify the _blockmul method to handle ZeroMatrix blocks correctly.\n\nLet me try to implement this.\n\nFirst, I need to modify the _blockmul method to handle ZeroMatrix blocks.\n\nHere's the modified code:\n\n    def _blockmul(self, other):\n        if (isinstance(other, BlockMatrix) and\n                self.colblocksizes == other.rowblocksizes):\n            # Create a new matrix to hold the result blocks\n            result_blocks = []\n            for i in range(self.blocks.rows):\n                row = []\n                for j in range(other.blocks.cols):\n                    # Compute the product of the i-th row of self.blocks and j-th column of other.blocks\n                    total = ZeroMatrix(self.rowblocksizes[i], other.colblocksizes[j])\n                    for k in range(self.blocks.cols):\n                        a = self.blocks[i, k]\n                        b = other.blocks[k, j]\n                        # Handle ZeroMatrix cases\n                        if isinstance(a, ZeroMatrix) or isinstance(b, ZeroMatrix):\n                            # The product is a ZeroMatrix of size (a.rows x b.cols)\n                            product = ZeroMatrix(a.rows, b.cols)\n                        else:\n                            product = a * b\n                        total += product\n                    row.append(total)\n                result_blocks.append(row)\n            return BlockMatrix(result_blocks)\n        return self * other\n\nThis code iterates through each block in the product and checks if either block is a ZeroMatrix. If so, it replaces the product with a ZeroMatrix of the appropriate size. Otherwise, it performs the regular multiplication.\n\nThis should prevent the ZeroMatrix from being replaced with a scalar zero, thus avoiding the AttributeError.\n\nNow, I need to apply this change to the blockmatrix.py file.\n\nBut before that, I need to confirm that this change will fix the issue.\n\nLet me test this modified code.\n\nIn the original issue, the code is:\n\n>>> a = MatrixSymbol(\"a\", 2, 2)\n>>> z = ZeroMatrix(2, 2)\n>>> b = BlockMatrix([[a, z], [z, z]])\n>>> block_collapse(b * b * b)\n\nThe first multiplication (b * b) works, but the second (b * b * b) throws an exception.\n\nWith the modified _blockmul method, when multiplying b * b, the ZeroMatrix blocks should remain as ZeroMatrix, and when multiplying again, they should still be ZeroMatrix, thus avoiding the error.\n\nSo, the modified code should fix the issue.\n\nNow, I need to apply this change to the blockmatrix.py file.\n\nBut first, I need to confirm that the ZeroMatrix is indeed being replaced with a Zero object during the multiplication.\n\nTo do this, I can run the reproduce script and check the type of the blocks after each multiplication.\n\nLet me create the reproduce_error.py script as follows:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\na = MatrixSymbol(\"a\", 2, 2)\nz = ZeroMatrix(2, 2)\nb = BlockMatrix([[a, z], [z, z]])\nprint(block_collapse(b * b))  # This should work\nprint(block_collapse(b * b * b))  # This should throw an exception\n```\n\nBut to see the types of the blocks, I can modify the script to print the types of the blocks after each multiplication.\n\nLet me modify the script to:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\na = MatrixSymbol(\"a\", 2, 2)\nz = ZeroMatrix(2, 2)\nb = BlockMatrix([[a, z], [z, z]])\n\n# First multiplication\nresult1 = block_collapse(b * b)\nprint(\"After first multiplication:\")\nfor i in range(result1.blocks.rows):\n    for j in range(result1.blocks.cols):\n        print(f\"Block ({i}, {j}): {type(result1.blocks[i, j])}\")\n\n# Second multiplication\nresult2 = block_collapse(result1 * b)\nprint(\"After second multiplication:\")\nfor i in range(result2.blocks.rows):\n    for j in range(result2.blocks.cols):\n        print(f\"Block ({i}, {j}): {type(result2.blocks[i, j])}\")\n```\n\nBut since the second multiplication throws an exception, I need to catch the exception and print the types before the exception occurs.\n\nAlternatively, I can run the code step by step and check the types.\n\nBut since I'm working in the current environment, I can create the reproduce_error.py script and run it to see the output.\n\nLet me create the script and run it.\n\nFirst, I need to create the reproduce_error.py file.\n\n<function=str_replace_editor>\n<parameter=command>create</parameter>\n<parameter=path>/workspace/reproduce_error.py</parameter>\n<parameter=file_text>\nfrom sympy import *\na = MatrixSymbol(\"a\", 2, 2)\nz = ZeroMatrix(2, 2)\nb = BlockMatrix([[a, z], [z, z]])\n\n# First multiplication\nresult1 = block_collapse(b * b)\nprint(\"After first multiplication:\")\nfor i in range(result1.blocks.rows):\n    for j in range(result1.blocks.cols):\n        print(f\"Block ({i}, {j}): {type(result1.blocks[i, j])}\")\n\n# Second multiplication\ntry:\n    result2 = block_collapse(result1 * b)\n    print(\"After second multiplication:\")\n    for i in range(result2.blocks.rows):\n        for j in range(result2.blocks.cols):\n            print(f\"Block ({i}, {j}): {type(result2.blocks[i, j])}\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Exception: {e}\")\n</parameter>\n</function>"}, {"role": "user", "content": "EXECUTION RESULT of [str_replace_editor]:\nFile created successfully at: /workspace/reproduce_error.py"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Great, the reproduce_error.py script has been created.

The traceback indicates that there's a ValueError being raised when trying to create a BlockMatrix. Specifically, the error message says:\n\n```\nValueError:\nexpecting a sequence of 1 or more rows containing Matrices.\n```\n\nThis suggests that the code is trying to create a BlockMatrix with invalid input, possibly due to the way the blocks are being multiplied.\n\nBut this is unexpected because the original code in the issue description works for the first multiplication. Maybe there's a difference in the environment or the codebase version.\n\nWait, the error occurs when trying to run the script, but according to the issue description, the first multiplication (b * b) works. However, in the current environment, when running the script, even the first multiplication (b * b) is causing an error.\n\nThis indicates that there might be a problem with the current codebase or the way the script is being executed.\n\nLet me check the code in the script again. The script is:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\na = MatrixSymbol(\"a\", 2, 2)\nz = ZeroMatrix(2, 2)\nb = BlockMatrix([[a, z], [z, z]])\n\n# First multiplication\nresult1 = block_collapse(b * b)\nprint(\"After first multiplication:\")\nfor i in range(result1.blocks.rows):\n    for j in range(result1.blocks.cols):\n        print(f\"Block ({i}, {j}): {type(result1.blocks[i, j])}\")\n\n# Second multiplication\ntry:\n    result2 = block_collapse(result1 * b)\n    print(\"After second multiplication:\")\n    for i in range(result2.blocks.rows):\n        for j in range(result2.blocks.cols):\n            print(f\"Block ({i}, {j}): {type(result2.blocks[i, j])}\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Exception: {e}\")\n```\n\nThe error occurs at the line `result1 = block_collapse(b * b)`, which suggests that the multiplication of `b * b` is failing.\n\nBut according to the issue description, the first multiplication works. So, there must be a difference in the environment or the codebase.\n\nPerhaps the codebase in the current environment is different from the one in the issue description. The issue mentions using SymPy 1.4, but the current codebase is version 1.5.\n\nAlternatively, there might be a problem with the way the BlockMatrix is being created.\n\nLet me check the code for creating the BlockMatrix. The user creates `b` as:\n\n```python\nb = BlockMatrix([[a, z], [z, z]])\n```\n\nBut according to the BlockMatrix class's __new__ method, it expects a sequence of rows containing Matrices. The error message suggests that the input to BlockMatrix is not a sequence of rows containing Matrices.\n\nWait, the error occurs in the BlockMatrix's __new__ method when creating the result of the multiplication. Let's look at the traceback:\n\n```\n  File \"/testbed/sympy/matrices/expressions/blockmatrix.py\", line 167, in _blockmul\n    return BlockMatrix(self.blocks*other.blocks)\n  File \"/testbed/sympy/matrices/expressions/blockmatrix.py\", line 86, in __new__\n    raise ValueError(filldedent('''\n```\n\nSo, the error is happening when trying to create a new BlockMatrix from the product of self.blocks and other.blocks. The product of self.blocks and other.blocks is not a valid input for BlockMatrix.\n\nThis suggests that the multiplication of self.blocks and other.blocks is not resulting in a valid matrix of matrices.\n\nBut why is that?\n\nLooking at the code for BlockMatrix's __new__ method, it checks that the input is a sequence of rows containing Matrices. If the input is not valid, it raises a ValueError.\n\nSo, the problem is that when multiplying self.blocks and other.blocks, the result is not a valid input for BlockMatrix.\n\nThis indicates that the multiplication of the blocks is not producing a matrix of matrices, but perhaps a scalar or something else.\n\nBut why would that happen?\n\nLet me think. The self.blocks and other.blocks are instances of ImmutableDenseMatrix, which are matrices of matrices. When multiplying them, the * operator is used, which performs matrix multiplication.\n\nBut if during the multiplication, one of the blocks is a ZeroMatrix, perhaps the result is a scalar zero instead of a ZeroMatrix.\n\nThis would explain why the input to BlockMatrix is invalid.\n\nSo, the root cause is that during the multiplication of the blocks, the ZeroMatrix is being replaced with a scalar zero, leading to the product being a scalar instead of a matrix of matrices.\n\nTo fix this, we need to ensure that when multiplying blocks, if any of the blocks is a ZeroMatrix, the result is a ZeroMatrix of the appropriate size, not a scalar zero.\n\nThis brings us back to the earlier idea of modifying the _blockmul method to handle ZeroMatrix blocks explicitly.\n\nSo, the solution is to modify the _blockmul method to handle ZeroMatrix blocks correctly, as I proposed earlier.\n\nLet me proceed to make that change.\n\nI need to edit the blockmatrix.py file and modify the _blockmul method.\n\nThe current code for _blockmul is:\n\n    def _blockmul(self, other):\n        if (isinstance(other, BlockMatrix) and\n                self.colblocksizes == other.rowblocksizes):\n            return BlockMatrix(self.blocks*other.blocks)\n        return self * other\n\nThe modified code should handle ZeroMatrix blocks correctly.\n\nHere's the modified code:\n\n    def _blockmul(self, other):\n        if (isinstance(other, BlockMatrix) and\n                self.colblocksizes == other.rowblocksizes):\n            # Create a new matrix to hold the result blocks\n            result_blocks = []\n            for i in range(self.blocks.rows):\n                row = []\n                for j in range(other.blocks.cols):\n                    # Compute the product of the i-th row of self.blocks and j-th column of other.blocks\n                    total = ZeroMatrix(self.rowblocksizes[i], other.colblocksizes[j])\n                    for k in range(self.blocks.cols):\n                        a = self.blocks[i, k]\n                        b = other.blocks[k, j]\n                        # Handle ZeroMatrix cases\n                        if isinstance(a, ZeroMatrix) or isinstance(b, ZeroMatrix):\n                            # The product is a ZeroMatrix of size (a.rows x b.cols)\n                            product = ZeroMatrix(a.rows, b.cols)\n                        else:\n                            product = a * b\n                        total += product\n                    row.append(total)\n                result_blocks.append(row)\n            return BlockMatrix(result_blocks)\n        return self * other\n\nThis code iterates through each block in the product and checks if either block is a ZeroMatrix. If so, it replaces the product with a ZeroMatrix of the appropriate size. Otherwise, it performs the regular multiplication.\n\nNow, I need to apply this change to the blockmatrix.py file.\n\nLet me open the file and find the _blockmul method.\n\nThe _blockmul method is located around line 164-170 in the blockmatrix.py file.\n\nI need to replace the existing _blockmul method with the new code.\n\nLet me use the str_replace_editor function to edit the file.\n\nFirst, I need to find the exact lines of the _blockmul method.\n\nFrom the previous view of the file, the _blockmul method starts at line 164:\n\n    164     def _blockmul(self, other):\n    165         if (isinstance(other, BlockMatrix) and\n    166                 self.colblocksizes == other.rowblocksizes):\n    167             return BlockMatrix(self.blocks*other.blocks)\n    168 \n    169         return self * other\n\nSo, the old_str is the existing code from line 164 to 169.\n\nThe new_str is the modified code.\n\nLet me prepare the str_replace command.\n\nThe old_str is:\n\n```python\n    def _blockmul(self, other):\n        if (isinstance(other, BlockMatrix) and\n                self.colblocksizes == other.rowblocksizes):\n            return BlockMatrix(self.blocks*other.blocks)\n        return self * other\n```\n\nThe new_str is:\n\n```python\n    def _blockmul(self, other):\n        if (isinstance(other, BlockMatrix) and\n                self.colblocksizes == other.rowblocksizes):\n            # Create a new matrix to hold the result blocks\n            result_blocks = []\n            for i in range(self.blocks.rows):\n                row = []\n                for j in range(other.blocks.cols):\n                    # Compute the product of the i-th row of self.blocks and j-th column of other.blocks\n                    total = ZeroMatrix(self.rowblocksizes[i], other.colblocksizes[j])\n                    for k in range(self.blocks.cols):\n                        a = self.blocks[i, k]\n                        b = other.blocks[k, j]\n                        # Handle ZeroMatrix cases\n                        if isinstance(a, ZeroMatrix) or isinstance(b, ZeroMatrix):\n                            # The product is a ZeroMatrix of size (a.rows x b.cols)\n                            product = ZeroMatrix(a.rows, b.cols)\n                        else:\n                            product = a * b\n                        total += product\n                    row.append(total)\n                result_blocks.append(row)\n            return BlockMatrix(result_blocks)\n        return self * other\n```\n\nNow, I need to use the str_replace_editor function to replace the old_str with the new_str in the blockmatrix.py file.\n\nBut first, I need to ensure that the old_str is unique in the file.

This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /workspace directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.\n", "role": "user"}, {"content": "Okay, let's tackle this issue. So, the problem is that when multiplying a BlockMatrix containing ZeroMatrix blocks multiple times, it throws an exception. The error occurs because after the first multiplication, the ZeroMatrix blocks are being replaced with Zero objects, which don't have the 'cols' attribute. That's causing the AttributeError when trying to access cols.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the SymPy repository. The uploaded directory is sympy__sympy__1.5, which is probably the SymPy codebase at version 1.5. The issue is related to the BlockMatrix and ZeroMatrix classes in the matrices module.\n\nThe error happens when multiplying the BlockMatrix three times. The first two multiplications work, but the third causes an exception. The problem seems to be that after the first multiplication, the ZeroMatrix blocks are being converted to Zero objects, which don't have the necessary attributes for further operations.\n\nSo, the key is to ensure that when a ZeroMatrix is involved in block multiplication, it remains a ZeroMatrix or is properly handled so that it has the required attributes like 'cols'.\n\nLet me start by exploring the repository structure. The BlockMatrix and ZeroMatrix classes are likely in the matrices/expressions directory. I should look into the blockmatrix.py file and see how ZeroMatrix is being handled during multiplication.\n\nFirst, I need to create a script that reproduces the error. Then, I can run it to confirm the issue. After that, I'll look into the code to find where the ZeroMatrix is being replaced with Zero and fix that.\n\nLet me start by creating a Python script that reproduces the error. I'll call it reproduce_error.py.\n\nThe script will contain the code from the issue description:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\na = MatrixSymbol(\"a\", 2, 2)\nz = ZeroMatrix(2, 2)\nb = BlockMatrix([[a, z], [z, z]])\nprint(block_collapse(b * b))  # This should work\nprint(block_collapse(b * b * b))  # This should throw an exception\n```\n\nI'll save this script and run it using the BashTool to see the error.\n\nOnce I confirm the error, I need to find where in the code the ZeroMatrix is being replaced with Zero. Looking at the error traceback, it seems that during the block multiplication, the ZeroMatrix is being converted to a Zero object, which doesn't have the 'cols' attribute.\n\nIn the blockmatrix.py file, the _blockmul method is where the multiplication happens. Let me check that method.\n\nLooking at the code for BlockMatrix._blockmul, it's possible that when multiplying blocks, if a block is a ZeroMatrix, it's being simplified to a Zero object. But why does this happen only after the first multiplication?\n\nAlternatively, maybe during the block multiplication, the ZeroMatrix is being treated as a scalar zero, leading to the replacement with a Zero object. But that's not correct because ZeroMatrix is a matrix, not a scalar.\n\nSo, the problem is that during the multiplication, the ZeroMatrix is being incorrectly replaced with a scalar zero, which doesn't have the necessary matrix attributes.\n\nTo fix this, we need to ensure that when a ZeroMatrix is involved in block multiplication, it remains a ZeroMatrix or is handled in a way that preserves its matrix structure.\n\nLet me look into the code for BlockMatrix._blockmul. The method is responsible for multiplying two BlockMatrix instances. It likely checks the block sizes and performs element-wise multiplication.\n\nIn the code, when multiplying two blocks, if one of them is a ZeroMatrix, the result should be a ZeroMatrix of appropriate size. However, it seems that in this case, the ZeroMatrix is being replaced with a scalar zero, leading to the error.\n\nSo, the fix would involve ensuring that when multiplying a ZeroMatrix with another matrix, the result is a ZeroMatrix of the correct size, rather than a scalar zero.\n\nLet me check the code for BlockMatrix._blockmul. The method probably has logic to handle multiplication of blocks, including ZeroMatrix blocks. There might be a condition where if a block is a ZeroMatrix, it's treated as a zero scalar, which is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ZeroMatrix is being simplified to a Zero object during some simplification step, which is then used in the block multiplication.\n\nTo find the exact cause, I need to look into the code where the ZeroMatrix is being replaced with Zero. Let's see.\n\nIn the error traceback, the exception occurs in the colblocksizes method of BlockMatrix. The code is trying to access self.blocks[0, i].cols, but self.blocks[0, i] is a Zero object, which doesn't have the 'cols' attribute.\n\nSo, the ZeroMatrix in the blocks is being replaced with a Zero object, which is causing the problem.\n\nLooking at the code for BlockMatrix, the blocks are stored in a matrix-like structure. When multiplying, the blocks are multiplied element-wise, and if a block is a ZeroMatrix, the result should be a ZeroMatrix of the appropriate size.\n\nBut in this case, it seems that during the multiplication, the ZeroMatrix is being replaced with a Zero object, which is a scalar, leading to the error.\n\nSo, the fix is to ensure that when multiplying a ZeroMatrix with another matrix, the result is a ZeroMatrix, not a scalar zero.\n\nTo do this, I need to find where in the code the ZeroMatrix is being replaced with Zero and prevent that from happening.\n\nLooking at the code for BlockMatrix._blockmul, perhaps there's a condition that checks if a block is a zero matrix and replaces it with a scalar zero. That would be incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe during the simplification of the block multiplication, the ZeroMatrix is being simplified to a Zero object.\n\nLet me check the code for BlockMatrix._blockmul. The method is part of the BlockMatrix class, and it's responsible for multiplying two BlockMatrix instances.\n\nIn the code, the _blockmul method likely checks the block sizes and performs element-wise multiplication. If a block is a ZeroMatrix, the result of multiplying it with another block should be a ZeroMatrix of the appropriate size.\n\nBut perhaps there's a condition where if a block is a ZeroMatrix, it's being treated as a scalar zero, leading to the replacement with a Zero object.\n\nTo fix this, I need to ensure that when a ZeroMatrix is involved in the multiplication, it's treated as a matrix, not a scalar.\n\nLooking at the code for BlockMatrix._blockmul, perhaps there's a line where it checks if a block is zero and replaces it with a scalar zero. That would be the issue.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ZeroMatrix is being simplified to a Zero object during some other step, like when the block is being processed for multiplication.\n\nTo find the exact location, I need to look into the code.\n\nLet me first check the blockmatrix.py file in the repository. The path should be something like /workspace/sympy__sympy__1.5/sympy/matrices/expressions/blockmatrix.py.\n\nI need to open this file and look for the _blockmul method.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the str_replace_editor function to view the file.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFirst, I need to find the path to the blockmatrix.py file.

The _blockmul method is defined in lines 164-170. Let me check that part again.\n\nThe _blockmul method is part of the BlockMatrix class. It checks if the other matrix is also a BlockMatrix and if the column block sizes of the current matrix match the row block sizes of the other matrix. If so, it multiplies the blocks using matrix multiplication (blocks*other.blocks) and returns a new BlockMatrix. Otherwise, it returns the product of the two matrices as a regular MatMul expression.\n\nBut in the case of the issue, when multiplying the BlockMatrix three times, the first multiplication works, but the second multiplication converts the ZeroMatrix blocks into Zero objects, leading to the error.\n\nLooking at the code, when multiplying two BlockMatrix instances, the blocks are multiplied element-wise. However, if a block is a ZeroMatrix, multiplying it with another block should result in a ZeroMatrix of the appropriate size. But in this case, it seems that the ZeroMatrix is being replaced with a scalar zero, which is causing the problem.\n\nSo, the issue is likely in how the blocks are being multiplied. When a ZeroMatrix is multiplied by another matrix, the result should be a ZeroMatrix, but instead, it's being treated as a scalar zero.\n\nTo fix this, I need to ensure that when a ZeroMatrix is involved in the multiplication, it's handled correctly and not replaced with a scalar zero.\n\nLooking at the code for BlockMatrix._blockmul, the line 167 is:\n\nreturn BlockMatrix(self.blocks*other.blocks)\n\nThis uses matrix multiplication of the blocks. However, when multiplying two matrices, if one of them is a ZeroMatrix, the result should be a ZeroMatrix of the appropriate size. But perhaps the current implementation is not handling this case correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ZeroMatrix is being simplified to a Zero object during the multiplication.\n\nTo find out, I need to look into how the blocks are being multiplied. The self.blocks and other.blocks are instances of ImmutableDenseMatrix, which is a matrix of matrices. When multiplying these, the * operator is used, which performs matrix multiplication.\n\nBut when multiplying a ZeroMatrix with another matrix, the result should be a ZeroMatrix. However, if the ZeroMatrix is being treated as a scalar zero, the multiplication would result in a scalar zero, which is incorrect.\n\nSo, the problem is that during the multiplication of the blocks, the ZeroMatrix is being treated as a scalar zero, leading to the replacement with a Zero object.\n\nTo fix this, I need to ensure that when multiplying a ZeroMatrix with another matrix, the result is a ZeroMatrix of the appropriate size.\n\nLooking into the code for ImmutableDenseMatrix multiplication, perhaps there's a condition that checks if a block is a zero matrix and replaces it with a scalar zero. That would be the issue.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ZeroMatrix is being simplified to a Zero object during the multiplication.\n\nTo find the exact location, I need to look into the code for ImmutableDenseMatrix multiplication.\n\nBut since the code for ImmutableDenseMatrix is part of the sympy.matrices.immutable module, which is not in the same file, I need to check that code.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is in the way the blocks are being multiplied. For example, when multiplying two blocks, if one of them is a ZeroMatrix, the result should be a ZeroMatrix of the appropriate size.\n\nBut in the current code, the blocks are multiplied using the * operator, which may not handle ZeroMatrix correctly.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to modify the _blockmul method to handle ZeroMatrix blocks explicitly.\n\nLet me think. When multiplying two blocks, if either block is a ZeroMatrix, the result should be a ZeroMatrix of the appropriate size. For example, if A is a ZeroMatrix of size (m x n) and B is a matrix of size (n x p), then the product should be a ZeroMatrix of size (m x p).\n\nBut in the current code, when multiplying the blocks, the * operator is used, which may not handle this case correctly.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to replace the line:\n\nreturn BlockMatrix(self.blocks*other.blocks)\n\nwith code that explicitly checks for ZeroMatrix blocks and handles them correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the ZeroMatrix is being simplified to a Zero object during the multiplication.\n\nTo confirm this, I can look into the code for the * operator on MatrixExpr.\n\nBut since this is a complex issue, perhaps the best approach is to modify the _blockmul method to handle ZeroMatrix blocks explicitly.\n\nLet me try to modify the _blockmul method to check if either block is a ZeroMatrix and handle it accordingly.\n\nFor example, in the _blockmul method, when multiplying two blocks, if either block is a ZeroMatrix, the result should be a ZeroMatrix of the appropriate size.\n\nSo, in the code for BlockMatrix._blockmul, after checking that the block sizes are compatible, we can iterate through each block and handle ZeroMatrix cases.\n\nBut how is the multiplication of the blocks handled? The current code uses self.blocks*other.blocks, which is matrix multiplication of the blocks.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is that when multiplying a ZeroMatrix with another matrix, the result is a scalar zero instead of a ZeroMatrix.\n\nTo fix this, we need to ensure that when multiplying a ZeroMatrix with another matrix, the result is a ZeroMatrix of the appropriate size.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to replace the line:\n\nreturn BlockMatrix(self.blocks*other.blocks)\n\nwith code that iterates through each block and handles ZeroMatrix cases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is in the way the blocks are being multiplied. For example, when multiplying two blocks, if one is a ZeroMatrix, the result should be a ZeroMatrix of the appropriate size.\n\nBut in the current code, the blocks are multiplied using the * operator, which may not handle this case correctly.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to replace the line:\n\nreturn BlockMatrix(self.blocks*other.blocks)\n\nwith code that explicitly checks for ZeroMatrix blocks and handles them.\n\nLet me try to modify the _blockmul method to handle ZeroMatrix blocks.\n\nHere's the current code for _blockmul:\n\n    def _blockmul(self, other):\n        if (isinstance(other, BlockMatrix) and\n                self.colblocksizes == other.rowblocksizes):\n            return BlockMatrix(self.blocks*other.blocks)\n        return self * other\n\nThe problem is that when multiplying self.blocks and other.blocks, the * operator is used, which may not handle ZeroMatrix correctly.\n\nSo, perhaps the fix is to replace the line:\n\nreturn BlockMatrix(self.blocks*other.blocks)\n\nwith code that iterates through each block and handles ZeroMatrix cases.\n\nFor example:\n\n        # Create a new matrix to hold the result blocks\n        result_blocks = []\n        for i in range(self.blocks.rows):\n            row = []\n            for j in range(other.blocks.cols):\n                # Compute the product of the i-th row of self.blocks and j-th column of other.blocks\n                total = ZeroMatrix(self.rowblocksizes[i], other.colblocksizes[j])\n                for k in range(self.blocks.cols):\n                    a = self.blocks[i, k]\n                    b = other.blocks[k, j]\n                    # Handle ZeroMatrix cases\n                    if isinstance(a, ZeroMatrix) or isinstance(b, ZeroMatrix):\n                        # The product is a ZeroMatrix of size (a.rows x b.cols)\n                        product = ZeroMatrix(a.rows, b.cols)\n                    else:\n                        product = a * b\n                    total += product\n                row.append(total)\n            result_blocks.append(row)\n        return BlockMatrix(result_blocks)\n\nBut this approach would require iterating through each block and handling the multiplication manually, which could be computationally expensive but ensures that ZeroMatrix blocks are handled correctly.\n\nHowever, this approach may not be efficient, but it's necessary to handle the ZeroMatrix cases correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the ZeroMatrix is being simplified to a Zero object during the multiplication. So, perhaps the fix is to prevent the simplification of ZeroMatrix to Zero.\n\nLooking at the code for ZeroMatrix, perhaps during the multiplication, the ZeroMatrix is being replaced with a Zero object.\n\nTo find out, I need to look into the code for ZeroMatrix and see how it's handled during multiplication.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the ZeroMatrix is being treated as a scalar zero during the multiplication.\n\nIn any case, the fix is to ensure that when a ZeroMatrix is multiplied by another matrix, the result is a ZeroMatrix of the appropriate size, not a scalar zero.\n\nSo, the solution is to modify the _blockmul method to handle ZeroMatrix blocks correctly.\n\nLet me try to implement this.\n\nFirst, I need to modify the _blockmul method to handle ZeroMatrix blocks.\n\nHere's the modified code:\n\n    def _blockmul(self, other):\n        if (isinstance(other, BlockMatrix) and\n                self.colblocksizes == other.rowblocksizes):\n            # Create a new matrix to hold the result blocks\n            result_blocks = []\n            for i in range(self.blocks.rows):\n                row = []\n                for j in range(other.blocks.cols):\n                    # Compute the product of the i-th row of self.blocks and j-th column of other.blocks\n                    total = ZeroMatrix(self.rowblocksizes[i], other.colblocksizes[j])\n                    for k in range(self.blocks.cols):\n                        a = self.blocks[i, k]\n                        b = other.blocks[k, j]\n                        # Handle ZeroMatrix cases\n                        if isinstance(a, ZeroMatrix) or isinstance(b, ZeroMatrix):\n                            # The product is a ZeroMatrix of size (a.rows x b.cols)\n                            product = ZeroMatrix(a.rows, b.cols)\n                        else:\n                            product = a * b\n                        total += product\n                    row.append(total)\n                result_blocks.append(row)\n            return BlockMatrix(result_blocks)\n        return self * other\n\nThis code iterates through each block in the product and checks if either block is a ZeroMatrix. If so, it replaces the product with a ZeroMatrix of the appropriate size. Otherwise, it performs the regular multiplication.\n\nThis should prevent the ZeroMatrix from being replaced with a scalar zero, thus avoiding the AttributeError.\n\nNow, I need to apply this change to the blockmatrix.py file.\n\nBut before that, I need to confirm that this change will fix the issue.\n\nLet me test this modified code.\n\nIn the original issue, the code is:\n\n>>> a = MatrixSymbol(\"a\", 2, 2)\n>>> z = ZeroMatrix(2, 2)\n>>> b = BlockMatrix([[a, z], [z, z]])\n>>> block_collapse(b * b * b)\n\nThe first multiplication (b * b) works, but the second (b * b * b) throws an exception.\n\nWith the modified _blockmul method, when multiplying b * b, the ZeroMatrix blocks should remain as ZeroMatrix, and when multiplying again, they should still be ZeroMatrix, thus avoiding the error.\n\nSo, the modified code should fix the issue.\n\nNow, I need to apply this change to the blockmatrix.py file.\n\nBut first, I need to confirm that the ZeroMatrix is indeed being replaced with a Zero object during the multiplication.\n\nTo do this, I can run the reproduce script and check the type of the blocks after each multiplication.\n\nLet me create the reproduce_error.py script as follows:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\na = MatrixSymbol(\"a\", 2, 2)\nz = ZeroMatrix(2, 2)\nb = BlockMatrix([[a, z], [z, z]])\nprint(block_collapse(b * b))  # This should work\nprint(block_collapse(b * b * b))  # This should throw an exception\n```\n\nBut to see the types of the blocks, I can modify the script to print the types of the blocks after each multiplication.\n\nLet me modify the script to:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\na = MatrixSymbol(\"a\", 2, 2)\nz = ZeroMatrix(2, 2)\nb = BlockMatrix([[a, z], [z, z]])\n\n# First multiplication\nresult1 = block_collapse(b * b)\nprint(\"After first multiplication:\")\nfor i in range(result1.blocks.rows):\n    for j in range(result1.blocks.cols):\n        print(f\"Block ({i}, {j}): {type(result1.blocks[i, j])}\")\n\n# Second multiplication\nresult2 = block_collapse(result1 * b)\nprint(\"After second multiplication:\")\nfor i in range(result2.blocks.rows):\n    for j in range(result2.blocks.cols):\n        print(f\"Block ({i}, {j}): {type(result2.blocks[i, j])}\")\n```\n\nBut since the second multiplication throws an exception, I need to catch the exception and print the types before the exception occurs.\n\nAlternatively, I can run the code step by step and check the types.\n\nBut since I'm working in the current environment, I can create the reproduce_error.py script and run it to see the output.\n\nLet me create the script and run it.\n\nFirst, I need to create the reproduce_error.py file.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"id": "toolu_02", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "str_replace_editor", "arguments": "{\"command\": \"create\", \"path\": \"/workspace/reproduce_error.py\", \"file_text\": \"from sympy import *\\na = MatrixSymbol(\\\"a\\\", 2, 2)\\nz = ZeroMatrix(2, 2)\\nb = BlockMatrix([[a, z], [z, z]])\\n\\n# First multiplication\\nresult1 = block_collapse(b * b)\\nprint(\\\"After first multiplication:\\\")\\nfor i in range(result1.blocks.rows):\\n    for j in range(result1.blocks.cols):\\n        print(f\\\"Block ({i}, {j}): {type(result1.blocks[i, j])}\\\")\\n\\n# Second multiplication\\ntry:\\n    result2 = block_collapse(result1 * b)\\n    print(\\\"After second multiplication:\\\")\\n    for i in range(result2.blocks.rows):\\n        for j in range(result2.blocks.cols):\\n            print(f\\\"Block ({i}, {j}): {type(result2.blocks[i, j])}\\\")\\nexcept Exception as e:\\n    print(f\\\"Exception: {e}\\\")\"}"}}]}, {"content": "File created successfully at: /workspace/reproduce_error.py", "role": "tool", "tool_call_id": "toolu_02", "name": "str_replace_editor"}, {"content": "Great, the reproduce_error.py script has been created.

The script is:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import *\na = MatrixSymbol(\"a\", 2, 2)\nz = ZeroMatrix(2, 2)\nb = BlockMatrix([[a, z], [z, z]])\n\n# First multiplication\nresult1 = block_collapse(b * b)\nprint(\"After first multiplication:\")\nfor i in range(result1.blocks.rows):\n    for j in range(result1.blocks.cols):\n        print(f\"Block ({i}, {j}): {type(result1.blocks[i, j])}\")\n\n# Second multiplication\ntry:\n    result2 = block_collapse(result1 * b)\n    print(\"After second multiplication:\")\n    for i in range(result2.blocks.rows):\n        for j in range(result2.blocks.cols):\n            print(f\"Block ({i}, {j}): {type(result2.blocks[i, j])}\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Exception: {e}\")\n```\n\nThe error occurs at the line `result1 = block_collapse(b * b)`, which suggests that the multiplication of `b * b` is failing.\n\nBut according to the issue description, the first multiplication works. So, there must be a difference in the environment or the codebase.\n\nPerhaps the codebase in the current environment is different from the one in the issue description. The issue mentions using SymPy 1.4, but the current codebase is version 1.5.\n\nAlternatively, there might be a problem with the way the BlockMatrix is being created.\n\nLet me check the code for creating the BlockMatrix. The user creates `b` as:\n\n```python\nb = BlockMatrix([[a, z], [z, z]])\n```\n\nBut according to the BlockMatrix class's __new__ method, it expects a sequence of rows containing Matrices. The error message suggests that the input to BlockMatrix is not a sequence of rows containing Matrices.\n\nWait, the error occurs in the BlockMatrix's __new__ method when creating the result of the multiplication. Let's look at the traceback:\n\n```\n  File \"/testbed/sympy/matrices/expressions/blockmatrix.py\", line 167, in _blockmul\n    return BlockMatrix(self.blocks*other.blocks)\n  File \"/testbed/sympy/matrices/expressions/blockmatrix.py\", line 86, in __new__\n    raise ValueError(filldedent('''\n```\n\nSo, the error is happening when trying to create a new BlockMatrix from the product of self.blocks and other.blocks. The product of self.blocks and other.blocks is not a valid input for BlockMatrix.\n\nThis suggests that the multiplication of self.blocks and other.blocks is not resulting in a valid matrix of matrices.\n\nBut why is that?\n\nLooking at the code for BlockMatrix's __new__ method, it checks that the input is a sequence of rows containing Matrices. If the input is not valid, it raises a ValueError.\n\nSo, the problem is that when multiplying self.blocks and other.blocks, the result is not a valid input for BlockMatrix.\n\nThis indicates that the multiplication of the blocks is not producing a matrix of matrices, but perhaps a scalar or something else.\n\nBut why would that happen?\n\nLet me think. The self.blocks and other.blocks are instances of ImmutableDenseMatrix, which are matrices of matrices. When multiplying them, the * operator is used, which performs matrix multiplication.\n\nBut if during the multiplication, one of the blocks is a ZeroMatrix, perhaps the result is a scalar zero instead of a ZeroMatrix.\n\nThis would explain why the input to BlockMatrix is invalid.\n\nSo, the root cause is that during the multiplication of the blocks, the ZeroMatrix is being replaced with a scalar zero, leading to the product being a scalar instead of a matrix of matrices.\n\nTo fix this, we need to ensure that when multiplying blocks, if any of the blocks is a ZeroMatrix, the result is a ZeroMatrix of the appropriate size, not a scalar zero.\n\nThis brings us back to the earlier idea of modifying the _blockmul method to handle ZeroMatrix blocks explicitly.\n\nSo, the solution is to modify the _blockmul method to handle ZeroMatrix blocks correctly, as I proposed earlier.\n\nLet me proceed to make that change.\n\nI need to edit the blockmatrix.py file and modify the _blockmul method.\n\nThe current code for _blockmul is:\n\n    def _blockmul(self, other):\n        if (isinstance(other, BlockMatrix) and\n                self.colblocksizes == other.rowblocksizes):\n            return BlockMatrix(self.blocks*other.blocks)\n        return self * other\n\nThe modified code should handle ZeroMatrix blocks correctly.\n\nHere's the modified code:\n\n    def _blockmul(self, other):\n        if (isinstance(other, BlockMatrix) and\n                self.colblocksizes == other.rowblocksizes):\n            # Create a new matrix to hold the result blocks\n            result_blocks = []\n            for i in range(self.blocks.rows):\n                row = []\n                for j in range(other.blocks.cols):\n                    # Compute the product of the i-th row of self.blocks and j-th column of other.blocks\n                    total = ZeroMatrix(self.rowblocksizes[i], other.colblocksizes[j])\n                    for k in range(self.blocks.cols):\n                        a = self.blocks[i, k]\n                        b = other.blocks[k, j]\n                        # Handle ZeroMatrix cases\n                        if isinstance(a, ZeroMatrix) or isinstance(b, ZeroMatrix):\n                            # The product is a ZeroMatrix of size (a.rows x b.cols)\n                            product = ZeroMatrix(a.rows, b.cols)\n                        else:\n                            product = a * b\n                        total += product\n                    row.append(total)\n                result_blocks.append(row)\n            return BlockMatrix(result_blocks)\n        return self * other\n\nThis code iterates through each block in the product and checks if either block is a ZeroMatrix. If so, it replaces the product with a ZeroMatrix of the appropriate size. Otherwise, it performs the regular multiplication.\n\nNow, I need to apply this change to the blockmatrix.py file.\n\nLet me open the file and find the _blockmul method.\n\nThe _blockmul method is located around line 164-170 in the blockmatrix.py file.\n\nI need to replace the existing _blockmul method with the new code.\n\nLet me use the str_replace_editor function to edit the file.\n\nFirst, I need to find the exact lines of the _blockmul method.\n\nFrom the previous view of the file, the _blockmul method starts at line 164:\n\n    164     def _blockmul(self, other):\n    165         if (isinstance(other, BlockMatrix) and\n    166                 self.colblocksizes == other.rowblocksizes):\n    167             return BlockMatrix(self.blocks*other.blocks)\n    168 \n    169         return self * other\n\nSo, the old_str is the existing code from line 164 to 169.\n\nThe new_str is the modified code.\n\nLet me prepare the str_replace command.\n\nThe old_str is:\n\n```python\n    def _blockmul(self, other):\n        if (isinstance(other, BlockMatrix) and\n                self.colblocksizes == other.rowblocksizes):\n            return BlockMatrix(self.blocks*other.blocks)\n        return self * other\n```\n\nThe new_str is:\n\n```python\n    def _blockmul(self, other):\n        if (isinstance(other, BlockMatrix) and\n                self.colblocksizes == other.rowblocksizes):\n            # Create a new matrix to hold the result blocks\n            result_blocks = []\n            for i in range(self.blocks.rows):\n                row = []\n                for j in range(other.blocks.cols):\n                    # Compute the product of the i-th row of self.blocks and j-th column of other.blocks\n                    total = ZeroMatrix(self.rowblocksizes[i], other.colblocksizes[j])\n                    for k in range(self.blocks.cols):\n                        a = self.blocks[i, k]\n                        b = other.blocks[k, j]\n                        # Handle ZeroMatrix cases\n                        if isinstance(a, ZeroMatrix) or isinstance(b, ZeroMatrix):\n                            # The product is a ZeroMatrix of size (a.rows x b.cols)\n                            product = ZeroMatrix(a.rows, b.cols)\n                        else:\n                            product = a * b\n                        total += product\n                    row.append(total)\n                result_blocks.append(row)\n            return BlockMatrix(result_blocks)\n        return self * other\n```\n\nNow, I need to use the str_replace_editor function to replace the old_str with the new_str in the blockmatrix.py file.\n\nBut first, I need to ensure that the old_str is unique in the file. Since the _blockmul method is only defined once in the file, this should be safe.\n\nLet me proceed with the replacement.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"id": "toolu_04", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "str_replace_editor", "arguments": "{\"command\": \"str_replace\", \"path\": \"/workspace/sympy__sympy__1.5/sympy/matrices/expressions/blockmatrix.py\", \"old_str\": \"def _blockmul(self, other):\\n        if (isinstance(other, BlockMatrix) and\\n                self.colblocksizes == other.rowblocksizes):\\n            return BlockMatrix(self.blocks*other.blocks)\\n        return self * other\", \"new_str\": \"def _blockmul(self, other):\\n        if (isinstance(other, BlockMatrix) and\\n                self.colblocksizes == other.rowblocksizes):\\n            # Create a new matrix to hold the result blocks\\n            result_blocks = []\\n            for i in range(self.blocks.rows):\\n                row = []\\n                for j in range(other.blocks.cols):\\n                    # Compute the product of the i-th row of self.blocks and j-th column of other.blocks\\n                    total = ZeroMatrix(self.rowblocksizes[i], other.colblocksizes[j])\\n                    for k in range(self.blocks.cols):\\n                        a = self.blocks[i, k]\\n                        b = other.blocks[k, j]\\n                        # Handle ZeroMatrix cases\\n                        if isinstance(a, ZeroMatrix) or isinstance(b, ZeroMatrix):\\n                            # The product is a ZeroMatrix of size (a.rows x b.cols)\\n                            product = ZeroMatrix(a.rows, b.cols)\\n                        else:\\n                            product = a * b\\n                        total += product\\n                    row.append(total)\\n                result_blocks.append(row)\\n            return BlockMatrix(result_blocks)\\n        return self * other\"}"}}]}, {"content": "ERROR:\nNo replacement was performed, old_str `def _blockmul(self, other):\n        if (isinstance(other, BlockMatrix) and\n                self.colblocksizes == other.rowblocksizes):\n            return BlockMatrix(self.blocks*other.blocks)\n        return self * other` did not appear verbatim in /workspace/sympy__sympy__1.5/sympy/matrices/expressions/blockmatrix.py.", "role": "tool", "tool_call_id": "toolu_04", "name": "str_replace_editor"}, {"content": "Hmm, the replacement failed because the old_str did not appear verbatim in the file.
