Consider the following issue description:\n\n<issue_description>\nAdd `nonform` CSS class for non form errors in FormSets\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Ties Jan Hefting)\n\t \nForms add the nonfield CSS class for non field errors in ErrorList instances. This is documented in a section on \u200brendering form error messages. Similarly, in FormSets I'd expect to see the nonform CSS class added for non form errors. This would allow a custom ErrorList to make a distinction in form field errors, non field errors (forms) and non form errors (FormSets) when rendering error messages. Therefore I'd suggest to add this nonform CSS class and document it for developers to use.\n\n</issue_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <issue_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /workspace directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5.

AFTER REASONING, EMIT ONE AND ONLY ONE FUNCTION CALL PER MESSAGE.\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, let's tackle this task. So, the issue is about adding a 'nonform' CSS class for non-form errors in FormSets. The current setup uses a 'nonfield' CSS class for non-field errors in forms, and now we need to do something similar for FormSets. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the Django repository. The uploaded directory is django__django__4.0, which is probably the Django 4.0 codebase. I should start by exploring the directory to find where FormSets are handled and where error messages are generated.\n\nLet me first check the directory structure. I can use the `ls` command to list the contents of the workspace directory. Then, I can navigate into the django__django__4.0 directory to see its structure.\n\nOnce I have an idea of the directory layout, I can look for the FormSet implementation. FormSets are part of Django's forms framework, so they're likely in the forms module. The main files might be in a directory like django/forms/formsets.py or something similar.\n\nThe issue mentions that non-form errors in FormSets should have a 'nonform' CSS class. Currently, non-field errors in forms have a 'nonfield' class. So, the fix probably involves modifying the way error messages are stored or rendered in FormSets to include this new class.\n\nI need to find where the error messages for FormSets are being handled. In Django, FormSets are collections of forms, and they can have errors that are not tied to any specific form, like if there's a problem with the number of forms submitted. These are non-form errors.\n\nLooking at the Django documentation, FormSets have a method called `non_form_errors()` which returns a list of errors that are not associated with any particular form in the FormSet. These errors are part of the FormSet's error list.\n\nThe CSS class for these errors needs to be 'nonform'. So, wherever the error messages are being rendered, they should check if the error is a non-form error and apply the 'nonform' class.\n\nI need to find where the error messages are being added to the ErrorList for FormSets. The ErrorList is a class that Django uses to hold error messages, and it can have CSS classes associated with them.\n\nIn the forms module, there might be a method that adds these non-form errors to the ErrorList with the appropriate CSS class. I need to locate that part of the code and modify it to include the 'nonform' class.\n\nAdditionally, the issue mentions that this should be documented. So, after making the code changes, I need to update the documentation to reflect this new CSS class for non-form errors in FormSets.\n\nBut since the user mentioned that they have already taken care of the test files, I don't need to worry about modifying any tests. My focus is on the source code changes.\n\nLet me start by exploring the directory structure.

The method `non_form_errors` is present, which returns the non-form errors. These errors are stored in `self._non_form_errors`, which is an instance of the `ErrorList` class.\n\nLooking at the `full_clean` method, which is responsible for validating the formset, I can see that non-form errors are added to `self._non_form_errors`. For example, in lines 343-354, there's a check for the management form's validity, and if it's invalid, a ValidationError is added to `self._non_form_errors`.\n\nSimilarly, in lines 374-384, other validation checks are performed, and any raised ValidationError is added to `self._non_form_errors`.\n\nThe `ErrorList` class is used here, and when errors are added to it, they are stored as instances of `ValidationError`. However, the CSS class for these errors isn't specified here. The `ErrorList` class in Django can take a CSS class when instantiated, but in this case, the `ErrorList` is created with `self.error_class()`, which is passed as a parameter to the BaseFormSet.\n\nWait, looking back at the `__init__` method of BaseFormSet (lines 66-107), the `error_class` is passed as a parameter and stored as `self.error_class`. Then, in the `full_clean` method, `self._non_form_errors` is initialized as `self.error_class()` (line 336). So, the `ErrorList` is created with the provided `error_class`.\n\nBut how are the CSS classes added to the errors? In Django, when rendering form errors, the `ErrorList` has a `css_classes` method that returns the CSS classes associated with the errors. For example, in forms, non-field errors are added with the 'error' class and 'nonfield' class.\n\nLooking at the `ErrorList` class in Django, it seems that when you create an `ErrorList` instance, you can pass a list of CSS classes. However, in the case of non-form errors in FormSets, it's possible that the `ErrorList` is being created without any specific CSS classes, and thus the 'nonform' class isn't being added.\n\nSo, the task is to ensure that when non-form errors are added to the `ErrorList`, they have the 'nonform' CSS class.\n\nLooking at the code, the `ErrorList` for non-form errors is created here:\n\nIn `full_clean` method (line 336):\n\n```python\nself._non_form_errors = self.error_class()\n```\n\nThen, errors are added to `self._non_form_errors` using `append` (e.g., line 344).\n\nBut the `ErrorList` class in Django allows adding CSS classes when creating the instance. However, in this case, the `error_class` is passed as a parameter, and it's likely that the `ErrorList` is being instantiated without any specific classes.\n\nWait, perhaps the `ErrorList` is being created with a default class. Let me check the `ErrorList` class definition.\n\nBut since the code for `ErrorList` isn't in this file, I need to find where it's defined. The `ErrorList` is imported from `django.forms.utils` (line 4). So, the `ErrorList` class is defined in `django/forms/utils.py`.\n\nI should check that file to see how the `ErrorList` is implemented.\n\n<function=str_replace_editor>\n<parameter=command>view</parameter>\n<parameter=path>/workspace/django__django__4.0/django/forms/utils.py</parameter>\n</function>"}, {"role": "user", "content": "EXECUTION RESULT of [str_replace_editor]:\nHere's the result of running `cat -n` on /workspace/django__django__4.0/django/forms/utils.py:\n     1\timport json\n     2\tfrom collections import UserList\n     3\t\n     4\tfrom django.conf import settings\n     5\tfrom django.core.exceptions import ValidationError\n     6\tfrom django.utils import timezone\n     7\tfrom django.utils.html import escape, format_html, format_html_join, html_safe\n     8\tfrom django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy as _\n     9\t\n    10\t\n    11\tdef pretty_name(name):\n    12\t    \"\"\"Convert 'first_name' to 'First name'.\"\"\"\n    13\t    if not name:\n    14\t        return ''\n    15\t    return name.replace('_', ' ').capitalize()\n    16\t\n    17\t\n    18\tdef flatatt(attrs):\n    19\t    \"\"\"\n    20\t    Convert a dictionary of attributes to a single string.\n    21\t    The returned string will contain a leading space followed by key=\"value\",\n    22\t    XML-style pairs.

Looking at the `__init__` method of `ErrorList` (lines 84-91), it takes an `error_class` parameter. If `error_class` is not provided, it defaults to 'errorlist'. Otherwise, it appends the provided `error_class` to 'errorlist'.\n\nSo, when creating an `ErrorList` instance, you can pass a CSS class to be added to the default 'errorlist' class. For example, `ErrorList(error_class='nonform')` would result in a class of 'errorlist nonform'.\n\nIn the case of non-form errors in FormSets, the `ErrorList` is created with `self.error_class()`, which is passed as a parameter to the BaseFormSet. However, looking back at the BaseFormSet's `__init__` method (line 76), `error_class` is passed as a parameter and stored as `self.error_class`.\n\nBut in the `full_clean` method of BaseFormSet (line 336), `self._non_form_errors` is initialized as `self.error_class()`. However, the `error_class` here is a class, not an instance. Wait, no. Wait, `self.error_class` is a class, and when you call `self.error_class()`, you're creating an instance of that class.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. The `error_class` parameter in the BaseFormSet's `__init__` method is a class, which is used to create instances of error lists. For example, in the forms, the default `error_class` is `ErrorList`, but you can pass a custom error list class.\n\nBut in the case of non-form errors, the `ErrorList` is created with `self.error_class()`, which is the `ErrorList` class. However, the `ErrorList` class's `__init__` method takes an `error_class` parameter, which is the CSS class to be added.\n\nBut in the current code, when `self._non_form_errors` is created, it's done as `self.error_class()`, which is `ErrorList()`, and since no `error_class` is provided, it defaults to 'errorlist'.\n\nBut the issue is that non-form errors should have a 'nonform' CSS class. So, the problem is that when non-form errors are added to the `ErrorList`, they are not being given the 'nonform' class.\n\nSo, the solution is to ensure that when the `ErrorList` for non-form errors is created, it includes the 'nonform' class.\n\nLooking at the code, the `ErrorList` for non-form errors is created here:\n\n```python\nself._non_form_errors = self.error_class()\n```\n\nBut `self.error_class` is the `ErrorList` class, and when instantiated without any parameters, it uses the default 'errorlist' class.\n\nTo add the 'nonform' class, we need to pass `error_class='nonform'` when creating the `ErrorList` instance.\n\nBut how can we do that? The `error_class` parameter in the BaseFormSet's `__init__` method is a class, not a CSS class. So, perhaps the `ErrorList` class needs to be modified to accept a CSS class when instantiated.\n\nWait, but the `ErrorList` class's `__init__` method already takes an `error_class` parameter. So, when creating an `ErrorList` instance, you can pass the CSS class.\n\nBut in the current code, when `self._non_form_errors` is created, it's done as `self.error_class()`, which is `ErrorList()`, and thus the CSS class is 'errorlist'.\n\nSo, to add the 'nonform' class, we need to pass `error_class='nonform'` when creating the `ErrorList` instance.\n\nBut how can we do that? The `error_class` parameter in the BaseFormSet is a class, not a CSS class. So, perhaps the solution is to modify the `ErrorList` class to automatically add the 'nonform' class when it's used for non-form errors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the `ErrorList` instances for non-form errors should be created with the 'nonform' class.\n\nBut how is the `ErrorList` for non-form errors created?

This is documented in a section on \u200brendering form error messages. Similarly, in FormSets I'd expect to see the nonform CSS class added for non form errors. This would allow a custom ErrorList to make a distinction in form field errors, non field errors (forms) and non form errors (FormSets) when rendering error messages. Therefore I'd suggest to add this nonform CSS class and document it for developers to use.\n\n</issue_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <issue_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>.

So, the issue is about adding a 'nonform' CSS class for non-form errors in FormSets. The current setup uses a 'nonfield' CSS class for non-field errors in forms, and now we need to do something similar for FormSets. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the Django repository. The uploaded directory is django__django__4.0, which is probably the Django 4.0 codebase. I should start by exploring the directory to find where FormSets are handled and where error messages are generated.\n\nLet me first check the directory structure. I can use the `ls` command to list the contents of the workspace directory. Then, I can navigate into the django__django__4.0 directory to see its structure.\n\nOnce I have an idea of the directory layout, I can look for the FormSet implementation. FormSets are part of Django's forms framework, so they're likely in the forms module. The main files might be in a directory like django/forms/formsets.py or something similar.\n\nThe issue mentions that non-form errors in FormSets should have a 'nonform' CSS class. Currently, non-field errors in forms have a 'nonfield' class. So, the fix probably involves modifying the way error messages are stored or rendered in FormSets to include this new class.\n\nI need to find where the error messages for FormSets are being handled. In Django, FormSets are collections of forms, and they can have errors that are not tied to any specific form, like if there's a problem with the number of forms submitted. These are non-form errors.\n\nLooking at the Django documentation, FormSets have a method called `non_form_errors()` which returns a list of errors that are not associated with any particular form in the FormSet. These errors are part of the FormSet's error list.\n\nThe CSS class for these errors needs to be 'nonform'. So, wherever the error messages are being rendered, they should check if the error is a non-form error and apply the 'nonform' class.\n\nI need to find where the error messages are being added to the ErrorList for FormSets. The ErrorList is a class that Django uses to hold error messages, and it can have CSS classes associated with them.\n\nIn the forms module, there might be a method that adds these non-form errors to the ErrorList with the appropriate CSS class. I need to locate that part of the code and modify it to include the 'nonform' class.\n\nAdditionally, the issue mentions that this should be documented. So, after making the code changes, I need to update the documentation to reflect this new CSS class for non-form errors in FormSets.\n\nBut since the user mentioned that they have already taken care of the test files, I don't need to worry about modifying any tests. My focus is on the source code changes.\n\nLet me start by exploring the directory structure.

The method `non_form_errors` is present, which returns the non-form errors. These errors are stored in `self._non_form_errors`, which is an instance of the `ErrorList` class.\n\nLooking at the `full_clean` method, which is responsible for validating the formset, I can see that non-form errors are added to `self._non_form_errors`. For example, in lines 343-354, there's a check for the management form's validity, and if it's invalid, a ValidationError is added to `self._non_form_errors`.\n\nSimilarly, in lines 374-384, other validation checks are performed, and any raised ValidationError is added to `self._non_form_errors`.\n\nThe `ErrorList` class is used here, and when errors are added to it, they are stored as instances of `ValidationError`. However, the CSS class for these errors isn't specified here. The `ErrorList` class in Django can take a CSS class when instantiated, but in this case, the `ErrorList` is created with `self.error_class()`, which is passed as a parameter to the BaseFormSet.\n\nWait, looking back at the `__init__` method of BaseFormSet (lines 66-107), the `error_class` is passed as a parameter and stored as `self.error_class`. Then, in the `full_clean` method, `self._non_form_errors` is initialized as `self.error_class()` (line 336). So, the `ErrorList` is created with the provided `error_class`.\n\nBut how are the CSS classes added to the errors? In Django, when rendering form errors, the `ErrorList` has a `css_classes` method that returns the CSS classes associated with the errors. For example, in forms, non-field errors are added with the 'error' class and 'nonfield' class.\n\nLooking at the `ErrorList` class in Django, it seems that when you create an `ErrorList` instance, you can pass a list of CSS classes. However, in the case of non-form errors in FormSets, it's possible that the `ErrorList` is being created without any specific CSS classes, and thus the 'nonform' class isn't being added.\n\nSo, the task is to ensure that when non-form errors are added to the `ErrorList`, they have the 'nonform' CSS class.\n\nLooking at the code, the `ErrorList` for non-form errors is created here:\n\nIn `full_clean` method (line 336):\n\n```python\nself._non_form_errors = self.error_class()\n```\n\nThen, errors are added to `self._non_form_errors` using `append` (e.g., line 344).\n\nBut the `ErrorList` class in Django allows adding CSS classes when creating the instance. However, in this case, the `error_class` is passed as a parameter, and it's likely that the `ErrorList` is being instantiated without any specific classes.\n\nWait, perhaps the `ErrorList` is being created with a default class.

Looking at the `__init__` method of `ErrorList` (lines 84-91), it takes an `error_class` parameter. If `error_class` is not provided, it defaults to 'errorlist'. Otherwise, it appends the provided `error_class` to 'errorlist'.\n\nSo, when creating an `ErrorList` instance, you can pass a CSS class to be added to the default 'errorlist' class. For example, `ErrorList(error_class='nonform')` would result in a class of 'errorlist nonform'.\n\nIn the case of non-form errors in FormSets, the `ErrorList` is created with `self.error_class()`, which is passed as a parameter to the BaseFormSet. However, looking back at the BaseFormSet's `__init__` method (line 76), `error_class` is passed as a parameter and stored as `self.error_class`.\n\nBut in the `full_clean` method of BaseFormSet (line 336), `self._non_form_errors` is initialized as `self.error_class()`. However, the `error_class` here is a class, not an instance. Wait, no. Wait, `self.error_class` is a class, and when you call `self.error_class()`, you're creating an instance of that class.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. The `error_class` parameter in the BaseFormSet's `__init__` method is a class, which is used to create instances of error lists. For example, in the forms, the default `error_class` is `ErrorList`, but you can pass a custom error list class.\n\nBut in the case of non-form errors, the `ErrorList` is created with `self.error_class()`, which is the `ErrorList` class. However, the `ErrorList` class's `__init__` method takes an `error_class` parameter, which is the CSS class to be added.\n\nBut in the current code, when `self._non_form_errors` is created, it's done as `self.error_class()`, which is `ErrorList()`, and since no `error_class` is provided, it defaults to 'errorlist'.\n\nBut the issue is that non-form errors should have a 'nonform' CSS class. So, the problem is that when non-form errors are added to the `ErrorList`, they are not being given the 'nonform' class.\n\nSo, the solution is to ensure that when the `ErrorList` for non-form errors is created, it includes the 'nonform' class.\n\nLooking at the code, the `ErrorList` for non-form errors is created here:\n\n```python\nself._non_form_errors = self.error_class()\n```\n\nBut `self.error_class` is the `ErrorList` class, and when instantiated without any parameters, it uses the default 'errorlist' class.\n\nTo add the 'nonform' class, we need to pass `error_class='nonform'` when creating the `ErrorList` instance.\n\nBut how can we do that? The `error_class` parameter in the BaseFormSet's `__init__` method is a class, not a CSS class. So, perhaps the `ErrorList` class needs to be modified to accept a CSS class when instantiated.\n\nWait, but the `ErrorList` class's `__init__` method already takes an `error_class` parameter. So, when creating an `ErrorList` instance, you can pass the CSS class.\n\nBut in the current code, when `self._non_form_errors` is created, it's done as `self.error_class()`, which is `ErrorList()`, and thus the CSS class is 'errorlist'.\n\nSo, to add the 'nonform' class, we need to pass `error_class='nonform'` when creating the `ErrorList` instance.\n\nBut how can we do that? The `error_class` parameter in the BaseFormSet is a class, not a CSS class.
