INITIAL ISSUE:
################################################################################
You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.
<IMPORTANT>
* If user provides a path, you should NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. Instead, you should explore the file system to find the file before working on it.
* When configuring git credentials, use "openhands" as the user.name and "openhands@all-hands.dev" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
* The assistant MUST NOT include comments in the code unless they are necessary to describe non-obvious behavior.
</IMPORTANT>
You have access to the following functions:

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #1: execute_bash ----
Description: Execute a bash command in the terminal.
* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, it should be run in the background and the output should be redirected to a file, e.g. command = `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`.
* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, the assistant can interact with the running process and send empty `command` to retrieve any additional logs, or send additional text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process, or send command like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process.
* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.

Parameters:
  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty string to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the currently running process. Note: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.
  (2) is_input (string, optional): If True, the command is an input to the running process. If False, the command is a bash command to be executed in the terminal. Default is False.
Allowed values: [`true`, `false`]
---- END FUNCTION #1 ----

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: finish ----
Description: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.
No parameters are required for this function.
---- END FUNCTION #2 ----

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----
Description: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files in plain-text format
* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user
* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep
* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file
* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`
* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`

Notes for using the `str_replace` command:
* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!
* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique
* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`

Parameters:
  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.
Allowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]
  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/workspace/file.py` or `/workspace`.
  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.
  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.
  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.
  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.
  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.
---- END FUNCTION #3 ----

--------------------- NEW TASK DESCRIPTION ---------------------
<uploaded_files>
/workspace/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.20
</uploaded_files>
I've uploaded a python code repository in the directory scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.20. Consider the following issue description:

<issue_description>
CountVectorizer's get_feature_names raise not NotFittedError when the vocabulary parameter is provided
If you initialize a `CounterVectorizer` and try to perform a transformation without training you will get a `NotFittedError` exception.

```python
In [1]: from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
In [2]: vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
In [3]: corpus = [
    ...:     'This is the first document.',
    ...:     'This is the second second document.',
    ...:     'And the third one.',
    ...:     'Is this the first document?',
    ...: ]

In [4]: vectorizer.transform(corpus)
NotFittedError: CountVectorizer - Vocabulary wasn't fitted.
```
On the other hand if you provide the `vocabulary` at the initialization of the vectorizer you could transform a corpus without a prior training, right?

```python
In [1]: from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer

In [2]: vectorizer = CountVectorizer()

In [3]: corpus = [
    ...:     'This is the first document.',
    ...:     'This is the second second document.',
    ...:     'And the third one.',
    ...:     'Is this the first document?',
    ...: ]

In [4]: vocabulary = ['and', 'document', 'first', 'is', 'one', 'second', 'the', 'third', 'this']

In [5]: vectorizer = CountVectorizer(vocabulary=vocabulary)

In [6]: hasattr(vectorizer, "vocabulary_")
Out[6]: False

In [7]: vectorizer.get_feature_names()
NotFittedError: CountVectorizer - Vocabulary wasn't fitted.

In [8]: vectorizer.transform(corpus)
Out[8]:
<4x9 sparse matrix of type '<class 'numpy.int64'>'
        with 19 stored elements in Compressed Sparse Row format>

In [9]: hasattr(vectorizer, "vocabulary_")
Out[9]: True
```

The `CountVectorizer`'s `transform` calls `_validate_vocabulary` method which sets the `vocabulary_` instance variable.

In the same manner I believe that the `get_feature_names` method should not raise `NotFittedError` if the vocabulary parameter is provided but the vectorizer has not been trained.


</issue_description>

Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <issue_description> are met?
I've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!
Your task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /workspace directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.
Follow these steps to resolve the issue:
1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.
2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error
3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue
4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!
5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well
Your thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.

================================================================================
RESPONSE:
Okay, let's tackle this issue. So, the problem is with the CountVectorizer's get_feature_names method. When the vocabulary is provided at initialization, but the vectorizer hasn't been fitted, calling get_feature_names still raises a NotFittedError. But according to the issue description, this shouldn't happen. Instead, it should return the feature names based on the provided vocabulary.

First, I need to understand the structure of the scikit-learn repository. The uploaded directory is scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.20, which probably corresponds to version 0.20 of scikit-learn. I should look into the feature_extraction module, specifically the text module where CountVectorizer is defined.

Let me start by exploring the repository to find the relevant files. The CountVectorizer is part of sklearn.feature_extraction.text, so the file should be in the feature_extraction/text.py or something similar. I need to find the source code for CountVectorizer.

Once I locate the file, I need to look into the get_feature_names method and see why it's raising a NotFittedError even when a vocabulary is provided. The issue seems to be that the method checks if the vocabulary_ attribute is set, and if not, raises the error. But when a vocabulary is provided at initialization, the vocabulary_ attribute might not be set until the first transform or fit is called.

So, the fix would be to modify the get_feature_names method to check if the vocabulary parameter was provided at initialization. If it was, then use that to generate the feature names, even if the vectorizer hasn't been fitted yet.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Find the CountVectorizer class in the scikit-learn repository.
2. Locate the get_feature_names method.
3. Check the current implementation of get_feature_names.
4. Modify the method to handle the case where a vocabulary is provided at initialization but the vectorizer hasn't been fitted.
5. Test the changes by running the reproduce script.

First, I need to find the CountVectorizer class. Let's start by navigating the directory structure.

I'll use the str_replace_editor function to view the directory structure. Let's start by viewing the contents of the scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.20 directory.

Okay, so the repository structure is quite extensive. The CountVectorizer is part of the feature_extraction module, so I need to look into the sklearn/feature_extraction/text.py file. Let me check if that file exists.

I'll use the str_replace_editor function to view the contents of the sklearn/feature_extraction directory.

   319	class HashingVectorizer(BaseEstimator, VectorizerMixin, TransformerMixin):
   320	    """Convert a collection of text documents to a matrix of token occurrences
   321	
   322	    It turns a collection of text documents into a scipy.sparse matrix holding
   323	    token occurrence counts (or binary occurrence information), possibly
   324	    normalized as token frequencies if norm='l1' or projected on the euclidean
   325	    unit sphere if norm='l2'.
   326	
   327	    This text vectorizer implementation uses the hashing trick to find the
   328	    token string name to feature integer index mapping.
   329	
   330	    This strategy has several advantages:
   331	
   332	    - it is very low memory scalable to large datasets as there is no need to
   333	      store a vocabulary dictionary in memory
   334	
   335	    - it is fast to pickle and un-pickle as it holds no state besides the
   336	      constructor parameters
   337	
   338	    - it can be used in a streaming (partial fit) or parallel pipeline as there
   339	      is no state computed during fit.
   340	
   341	    There are also a couple of cons (vs using a CountVectorizer with an
   342	    in-memory vocabulary):
   343	
   344	    - there is no way to compute the inverse transform (from feature indices to
   345	      string feature names) which can be a problem when trying to introspect
   346	      which features are most important to a model.
   347	
   348	    - there can be collisions: distinct tokens can be mapped to the same
   349	      feature index. However in practice this is rarely an issue if n_features
   350	      is large enough (e.g. 2 ** 18 for text classification problems).
   351	
   352	    - no IDF weighting as this would render the transformer stateful.
   353	
   354	    The hash function employed is the signed 32-bit version of Murmurhash3.
   355	
   356	    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <text_feature_extraction>`.
   357	
   358	    Parameters
   359	    ----------
   360	
   361	    input : string {'filename', 'file', 'content'}
   362	        If 'filename', the sequence passed as an argument to fit is
   363	        expected to be a list of filenames that need reading to fetch
   364	        the raw content to analyze.
   365	
   366	        If 'file', the sequence items must have a 'read' method (file-like
   367	        object) that is called to fetch the bytes in memory.
   368	
   369	        Otherwise the input is expected to be the sequence strings or
   370	        bytes items are expected to be analyzed directly.
   371	
   372	    encoding : string, default='utf-8'
   373	        If bytes or files are given to analyze, this encoding is used to
   374	        decode.
   375	
   376	    decode_error : {'strict', 'ignore', 'replace'}
   377	        Instruction on what to do if a byte sequence is given to analyze that
   378	        contains characters not of the given `encoding`. By default, it is
   379	        'strict', meaning that a UnicodeDecodeError will be raised. Other
   380	        values are 'ignore' and 'replace'.
   381	
   382	    strip_accents : {'ascii', 'unicode', None}
   383	        Remove accents and perform other character normalization
   384	        during the preprocessing step.
   385	        'ascii' is a fast method that only works on characters that have
   386	        an direct ASCII mapping.
   387	        'unicode' is a slightly slower method that works on any characters.
   388	        None (default) does nothing.
   389	
   390	        Both 'ascii' and 'unicode' use NFKD normalization from
   391	        :func:`unicodedata.normalize`.
   392	
   393	    analyzer : string, {'word', 'char', 'char_wb'} or callable
   394	        Whether the feature should be made of word or character n-grams.
   395	        Option 'char_wb' creates character n-grams only from text inside
   396	        word boundaries; n-grams at the edges of words are padded with space.
   397	
   398	        If a callable is passed it is used to extract the sequence of features
   399	        out of the raw, unprocessed input.

   404	
   405	    tokenizer : callable or None (default)
   406	        Override the string tokenization step while preserving the
   407	        preprocessing and n-grams generation steps.
   408	        Only applies if ``analyzer == 'word'``.
   409	
   410	    ngram_range : tuple (min_n, max_n), default=(1, 1)
   411	        The lower and upper boundary of the range of n-values for different
   412	        n-grams to be extracted. All values of n such that min_n <= n <= max_n
   413	        will be used.
   414	
   415	    stop_words : string {'english'}, list, or None (default)
   416	        If 'english', a built-in stop word list for English is used.
   417	
   418	        If a list, that list is assumed to contain stop words, all of which
   419	        will be removed from the resulting tokens.
   420	        Only applies if ``analyzer == 'word'``.
   421	
   422	    lowercase : boolean, default=True
   423	        Convert all characters to lowercase before tokenizing.
   424	
   425	    token_pattern : string
   426	        Regular expression denoting what constitutes a "token", only used
   427	        if ``analyzer == 'word'``. The default regexp selects tokens of 2
   428	        or more alphanumeric characters (punctuation is completely ignored
   429	        and always treated as a token separator).
   430	
   431	    n_features : integer, default=(2 ** 20)
   432	        The number of features (columns) in the output matrices. Small numbers
   433	        of features are likely to cause hash collisions, but large numbers
   434	        will cause larger coefficient dimensions in linear learners.
   435	
   436	    norm : 'l1', 'l2' or None, optional
   437	        Norm used to normalize term vectors. None for no normalization.
   438	
   439	    binary : boolean, default=False.
   440	        If True, all non zero counts are set to 1. This is useful for discrete
   441	        probabilistic models that model binary events rather than integer
   442	        counts.
   443	
   444	    dtype : type, optional
   445	        Type of the matrix returned by fit_transform() or transform().
   446	
   447	    alternate_sign : boolean, optional, default True
   448	        When True, an alternating sign is added to the features as to
   449	        approximately conserve the inner product in the hashed space even for
   450	        small n_features. This approach is similar to sparse random projection.
   451	
   452	        .. versionadded:: 0.19
   453	
   454	    non_negative : boolean, optional, default False
   455	        When True, an absolute value is applied to the features matrix prior to
   456	        returning it. When used in conjunction with alternate_sign=True, this
   457	        significantly reduces the inner product preservation property.
   458	
   459	        .. deprecated:: 0.19

   648	        When building the vocabulary ignore terms that have a document

  1011	    document-frequency. This is a common term weighting scheme in information
  1012	    retrieval, that has also found good use in document classification.
  1013	
  1014	    The goal of using tf-idf instead of the raw frequencies of occurrence of a
  1015	    token in a given document is to scale down the impact of tokens that occur
  1016	    very frequently in a given corpus and that are hence empirically less
  1017	    informative than features that occur in a small fraction of the training
  1018	    corpus.
  1019	
  1020	    The formula that is used to compute the tf-idf of term t is
  1021	    tf-idf(d, t) = tf(t) * idf(d, t), and the idf is computed as
  1022	    idf(d, t) = log [ n / df(d, t) ] + 1 (if ``smooth_idf=False``),
  1023	    where n is the total number of documents and df(d, t) is the
  1024	    document frequency; the document frequency is the number of documents d
  1025	    that contain term t. The effect of adding "1" to the idf in the equation
  1026	    above is that terms with zero idf, i.e., terms  that occur in all documents
  1027	    in a training set, will not be entirely ignored.
  1028	    (Note that the idf formula above differs from the standard
  1029	    textbook notation that defines the idf as
  1030	    idf(d, t) = log [ n / (df(d, t) + 1) ]).
  1031	
  1032	    If ``smooth_idf=True`` (the default), the constant "1" is added to the
  1033	    numerator and denominator of the idf as if an extra document was seen
  1034	    containing every term in the collection exactly once, which prevents
  1035	    zero divisions: idf(d, t) = log [ (1 + n) / (1 + df(d, t)) ] + 1.
  1036	
  1037	    Furthermore, the formulas used to compute tf and idf depend
  1038	    on parameter settings that correspond to the SMART notation used in IR
  1039	    as follows:
  1040	
  1041	    Tf is "n" (natural) by default, "l" (logarithmic) when
  1042	    ``sublinear_tf=True``.
  1043	    Idf is "t" when use_idf is given, "n" (none) otherwise.
  1044	    Normalization is "c" (cosine) when ``norm='l2'``, "n" (none)
  1045	    when ``norm=None``.

RESPONSE:
Ah, there it is. The get_feature_names method is defined starting at line 994.

The method is:

```python
def get_feature_names(self):
    """Array mapping from feature integer indices to feature name"""
    self._check_vocabulary()

    return [t for t, i in sorted(six.iteritems(self.vocabulary_),
                                 key=itemgetter(1))]
```

The issue is that this method calls `self._check_vocabulary()`, which in turn checks if the vocabulary_ attribute is fitted. If not, it raises a NotFittedError. However, according to the issue description, when a vocabulary is provided at initialization, the get_feature_names method should return the feature names based on that vocabulary, even if the vectorizer hasn't been fitted.

So, the problem is that the _check_vocabulary method is being called, which checks if the vocabulary_ attribute is present. But when a vocabulary is provided at initialization (i.e., self.vocabulary is not None), the vectorizer should use that vocabulary to generate the feature names, even if it hasn't been fitted.

Looking at the code, the _check_vocabulary method is defined earlier in the file. Let me check its definition.

   322	    It turns a collection of text documents into a scipy.sparse matrix holding

   324	    normalized as token frequencies if norm='l1' or projected on the euclidean
   325	    unit sphere if norm='l2'.
   326	
   327	    This text vectorizer implementation uses the hashing trick to find the
   328	    token string name to feature integer index mapping.
   329	
   330	    This strategy has several advantages:
   331	
   332	    - it is very low memory scalable to large datasets as there is no need to
   333	      store a vocabulary dictionary in memory
   334	
   335	    - it is fast to pickle and un-pickle as it holds no state besides the
   336	      constructor parameters
   337	
   338	    - it can be used in a streaming (partial fit) or parallel pipeline as there
   339	      is no state computed during fit.
   340	
   341	    There are also a couple of cons (vs using a CountVectorizer with an
   342	    in-memory vocabulary):
   343	
   344	    - there is no way to compute the inverse transform (from feature indices to
   345	      string feature names) which can be a problem when trying to introspect
   346	      which features are most important to a model.
   347	
   348	    - there can be collisions: distinct tokens can be mapped to the same
   349	      feature index. However in practice this is rarely an issue if n_features
   350	      is large enough (e.g. 2 ** 18 for text classification problems).
   351	


================================================================================
RESPONSE:
The _check_vocabulary method is defined as follows:

```python
def _check_vocabulary(self):
    """Check if vocabulary is empty or missing (not fit-ed)"""
    msg = "%(name)s - Vocabulary wasn't fitted."
    check_is_fitted(self, 'vocabulary_', msg=msg),

    if len(self.vocabulary_) == 0:
        raise ValueError("Vocabulary is empty")

This method checks if the vocabulary_ attribute is fitted using the check_is_fitted function from sklearn.utils.validation. If the vocabulary_ is not present, it raises a NotFittedError. Then, it also checks if the vocabulary_ is empty and raises a ValueError if it is.

The problem here is that when a vocabulary is provided at initialization (i.e., self.vocabulary is not None), the vectorizer should use that vocabulary to generate the feature names, even if the vectorizer hasn't been fitted. However, the current implementation of _check_vocabulary checks if the vocabulary_ attribute is present, which is only set during fitting. If the vectorizer is initialized with a vocabulary parameter, but hasn't been fitted, the vocabulary_ attribute is not set, leading to the NotFittedError.

So, the fix should be to modify the _check_vocabulary method to consider the presence of the vocabulary parameter provided at initialization. If the vocabulary parameter is provided, then the vocabulary_ attribute should be set during initialization, not during fitting. Alternatively, the get_feature_names method should check if the vocabulary parameter is provided and use that instead of checking the vocabulary_ attribute.

Looking at the CountVectorizer's __init__ method, the vocabulary parameter is stored in self.vocabulary. However, during fitting, the vocabulary_ attribute is set. So, the issue is that when a vocabulary is provided at initialization, the self.vocabulary attribute is set, but the self.vocabulary_ attribute is not set until fitting. Therefore, when get_feature_names is called, it checks self.vocabulary_, which is not set, leading to the NotFittedError.

To fix this, the CountVectorizer should set the vocabulary_ attribute during initialization if a vocabulary is provided. Alternatively, the _check_vocabulary method should check if the vocabulary parameter is provided and use that instead of checking the vocabulary_ attribute.

Let me check the __init__ method of CountVectorizer to see how the vocabulary parameter is handled.

================================================================================
LAST RESPONSE:
In the __init__ method of CountVectorizer, the vocabulary parameter is stored in self.vocabulary. However, the self.vocabulary_ attribute is only set during fitting. So, when a vocabulary is provided at initialization, self.vocabulary is set, but self.vocabulary_ is not set until the vectorizer is fitted. Therefore, when get_feature_names is called, it checks self.vocabulary_, which is not set, leading to the NotFittedError.

The solution is to set self.vocabulary_ during initialization if a vocabulary is provided. This way, when get_feature_names is called, self.vocabulary_ is already set, and the _check_vocabulary method will not raise an error.

Looking at the code, the _validate_vocabulary method is called during fitting to validate the vocabulary. Let me check where self.vocabulary_ is set.

In the fit method, the code calls self._validate_vocabulary(), which in turn calls self._validate_vocabulary() (wait, that's a recursive call? Probably not. Let me check the code again.)

Wait, the fit method calls self._validate_vocabulary(), which is a method that validates the vocabulary. Let me check the _validate_vocabulary method.
