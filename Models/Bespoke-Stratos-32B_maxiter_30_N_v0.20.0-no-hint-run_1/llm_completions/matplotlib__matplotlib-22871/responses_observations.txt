INITIAL ISSUE:
################################################################################
You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.
<IMPORTANT>
* If user provides a path, you should NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. Instead, you should explore the file system to find the file before working on it.
* When configuring git credentials, use "openhands" as the user.name and "openhands@all-hands.dev" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
* The assistant MUST NOT include comments in the code unless they are necessary to describe non-obvious behavior.
</IMPORTANT>
You have access to the following functions:

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #1: execute_bash ----
Description: Execute a bash command in the terminal.
* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, it should be run in the background and the output should be redirected to a file, e.g. command = `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`.
* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, the assistant can interact with the running process and send empty `command` to retrieve any additional logs, or send additional text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process, or send command like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process.
* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.

Parameters:
  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty string to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the currently running process. Note: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.
  (2) is_input (string, optional): If True, the command is an input to the running process. If False, the command is a bash command to be executed in the terminal. Default is False.
Allowed values: [`true`, `false`]
---- END FUNCTION #1 ----

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: finish ----
Description: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.
No parameters are required for this function.
---- END FUNCTION #2 ----

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----
Description: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files in plain-text format
* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user
* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep
* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file
* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`
* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`

Notes for using the `str_replace` command:
* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!
* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique
* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`

Parameters:
  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.
Allowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]
  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/workspace/file.py` or `/workspace`.
  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.
  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.
  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.
  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.
  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.

I've uploaded a python code repository in the directory matplotlib__matplotlib__3.5. Consider the following issue description:

<issue_description>
[Bug]: ConciseDateFormatter not showing year anywhere when plotting <12 months
### Bug summary

When I plot < 1 year and January is not included in the x-axis, the year doesn't show up anywhere.
This bug is different from bug #21670 (fixed in #21785).

### Code for reproduction

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.dates as mdates
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

#create time array
initial = datetime(2021,2,14,0,0,0)
time_array = [initial + timedelta(days=x) for x in range(1,200)]

#create data array
data = [-x**2/20000 for x in range(1,200)]


#plot data
fig,ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(time_array,data) 
        
locator = mdates.AutoDateLocator()
formatter = mdates.ConciseDateFormatter(locator)

ax.grid(True)
ax.set_ylabel("Temperature ($\degree$C)")
ax.xaxis.set_major_locator(locator)   
ax.xaxis.set_major_formatter(formatter)
fig.autofmt_xdate() #automatically makes the x-labels rotate
```


### Actual outcome

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15143365/154090257-c7813f1c-f9ea-4252-86bf-f84e449c2f46.png)


### Expected outcome

I expect the year "2021" to show in the offset, to the right of the x-axis

### Additional information

I'm using Spyder IDE, v5.1.5

### Operating system

Windows 10

### Matplotlib Version

3.4.3

### Matplotlib Backend

Qt5Agg

### Python version

3.9.1

### Jupyter version

_No response_

### Installation

conda

</issue_description>

Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <issue_description> are met?
I've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!
Your task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /workspace directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.
Follow these steps to resolve the issue:
1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.
2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error
3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue
4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!
5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well
Your thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.

================================================================================
RESPONSE:
Okay, let's tackle this issue. So, the problem is that when plotting a time range of less than a year and January isn't included in the x-axis, the year doesn't show up anywhere. The user expects the year to appear in the offset to the right of the x-axis. The current version of Matplotlib they're using is 3.4.3, and they're using the ConciseDateFormatter.

First, I need to understand how the ConciseDateFormatter works. From what I remember, the ConciseDateFormatter is designed to automatically adjust the date format based on the range of dates being plotted. It tries to show the most relevant information, like the year, month, day, etc., depending on the span of the data.

In this case, when the data spans less than a year and doesn't include January, the year isn't being displayed. The user expects the year to be shown in the offset label. So, the fix likely involves modifying the ConciseDateFormatter to ensure that the year is included in the offset when necessary.

Let me start by exploring the repository structure. The uploaded directory is matplotlib__matplotlib__3.5, which probably contains the Matplotlib source code. I need to find where the ConciseDateFormatter is defined. Typically, Matplotlib's date formatters are in the dates module, so I should look in matplotlib/dates.py or a similar file.

Once I locate the ConciseDateFormatter code, I can analyze how it determines what to display in the offset. The offset is the part that shows the base date, like the year, so that the axis labels can be more concise. For example, if all dates are in the same year, the year might be shown in the offset, and the axis labels would show just the month and day.

The problem here is that when the date range is less than a year but doesn't include January, the formatter isn't adding the year to the offset. So, perhaps the logic that determines whether to include the year in the offset is flawed.

I need to find the part of the code that calculates the offset and the units. The ConciseDateFormatter probably has a method that determines the appropriate units (like years, months, days) based on the date range. Then, it formats the dates accordingly, possibly using the offset to show the base year.

Let me try to reproduce the issue first. The user provided code that creates a time array starting from February 14, 2021, and spans about 200 days, which is less than a year. When plotted, the year isn't shown in the offset. So, I need to run this code and see the output.

But since I'm in a different environment, I need to make sure that the code is executed correctly. Let me create a Python script with the provided code and run it.

First, I'll create a file called reproduce_issue.py in the workspace directory. Then, I'll execute it using Python.

Let me start by creating the script.

<function=str_replace_editor>
<parameter=command>create</parameter>
<parameter=path>/workspace/reproduce_issue.py</parameter>
<parameter=file_text>
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.dates as mdates
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

#create time array
initial = datetime(2021,2,14,0,0,0)
time_array = [initial + timedelta(days=x) for x in range(1,200)]

#create data array
data = [-x**2/20000 for x in range(1,200)]

#plot data
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(time_array, data) 

locator = mdates.AutoDateLocator()
formatter = mdates.ConciseDateFormatter(locator)

ax.grid(True)
ax.set_ylabel("Temperature (°C)")
ax.xaxis.set_major_locator(locator)   
ax.xaxis.set_major_formatter(formatter)
fig.autofmt_xdate() #automatically makes the x-labels rotate

plt.show()
</parameter>


---------------------------------------- OBSERVATION ----------------------------------------
EXECUTION RESULT of [str_replace_editor]:
File created successfully at: /workspace/reproduce_issue.py

================================================================================
RESPONSE:
Great, the script has been created. Now, I need to run it to see the issue. However, since I'm in a headless environment, I can't directly see the plot. But perhaps the problem can be diagnosed by checking the axis labels and the offset text.

Alternatively, I can modify the script to save the figure as an image and then check the image. Let me adjust the script to save the figure instead of showing it.

<function=str_replace_editor>
<parameter=command>str_replace</parameter>
<parameter=path>/workspace/reproduce_issue.py</parameter>
<parameter=old_str>plt.show()</parameter>
<parameter=new_str>plt.savefig('reproduce_issue.png')</parameter>


---------------------------------------- OBSERVATION ----------------------------------------
EXECUTION RESULT of [str_replace_editor]:
The file /workspace/reproduce_issue.py has been edited. Here's the result of running `cat -n` on a snippet of /workspace/reproduce_issue.py:
    22	ax.xaxis.set_major_locator(locator)   
    23	ax.xaxis.set_major_formatter(formatter)
    24	fig.autofmt_xdate() #automatically makes the x-labels rotate
    25	
    26	plt.savefig('reproduce_issue.png')
Review the changes and make sure they are as expected. Edit the file again if necessary.

================================================================================
RESPONSE:
Perfect, the script now saves the figure as 'reproduce_issue.png' instead of displaying it. Now, let's run the script to generate the image.

<function=execute_bash>
<parameter=command>
python3 /workspace/reproduce_issue.py

================================================================================
RESPONSE:
The script ran successfully and saved the image as 'reproduce_issue.png'. However, since I can't view the image directly, I need to find another way to check the axis labels and the offset text.

Alternatively, I can modify the script to print the axis labels and the offset text. Let's adjust the script to print these details.

<function=str_replace_editor>
<parameter=command>str_replace</parameter>
<parameter=path>/workspace/reproduce_issue.py</parameter>

    26	print(ax.xaxis.get_major_formatter().get_offset())
    27	plt.savefig('reproduce_issue.png')
Review the changes and make sure they are as expected. Edit the file again if necessary.

================================================================================
RESPONSE:
The script now prints the offset text. Let's run it again to see what the offset is.

<function=execute_bash>
<parameter=command>python3 /workspace/reproduce_issue.py</parameter>

================================================================================
RESPONSE:
Hmm, the command ran successfully, but there's no output printed. That suggests that the offset is empty or not being captured. Let me check the script again. Maybe the print statement is not being executed because of some error, or perhaps the offset is empty.

Alternatively, I can add more print statements to debug. Let's print the formatter's offset and the labels.

<function=str_replace_editor>
<parameter=command>str_replace</parameter>
<parameter=path>/workspace/reproduce_issue.py</parameter>
<parameter=old_str>print(ax.xaxis.get_major_formatter().get_offset())</parameter>

[Command finished with exit code 0]

================================================================================
RESPONSE:
The output shows that the offset is empty, and all the x-axis labels are empty strings. That explains why the year isn't being displayed. The ConciseDateFormatter isn't setting the offset or the labels correctly in this case.

Now, I need to find where in the ConciseDateFormatter code this logic is handled. The ConciseDateFormatter is part of Matplotlib's dates module. Let's look for the ConciseDateFormatter class in the repository.

The repository is located at /workspace/matplotlib__matplotlib__3.5. Let me navigate to the dates module.

    12	    import numpy as np
    13	
    14	    times = np.arange(np.datetime64('2001-01-02'),
    15	                      np.datetime64('2002-02-03'), np.timedelta64(75, 'm'))
    16	    y = np.random.randn(len(times))
    17	
    18	    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    19	    ax.plot(times, y)

    29	Matplotlib date format
    30	----------------------
    31	
    32	Matplotlib represents dates using floating point numbers specifying the number
    33	of days since a default epoch of 1970-01-01 UTC; for example,
    34	1970-01-01, 06:00 is the floating point number 0.25. The formatters and
    35	locators require the use of `datetime.datetime` objects, so only dates between
    36	year 0001 and 9999 can be represented.  Microsecond precision
    37	is achievable for (approximately) 70 years on either side of the epoch, and
    38	20 microseconds for the rest of the allowable range of dates (year 0001 to
    39	9999). The epoch can be changed at import time via `.dates.set_epoch` or
    40	:rc:`dates.epoch` to other dates if necessary; see
    41	:doc:`/gallery/ticks/date_precision_and_epochs` for a discussion.
    42	
    43	.. note::
    44	
    45	   Before Matplotlib 3.3, the epoch was 0000-12-31 which lost modern
    46	   microsecond precision and also made the default axis limit of 0 an invalid
    47	   datetime.  In 3.3 the epoch was changed as above.  To convert old
    48	   ordinal floats to the new epoch, users can do::
    49	
    50	     new_ordinal = old_ordinal + mdates.date2num(np.datetime64('0000-12-31'))
    51	
    52	
    53	There are a number of helper functions to convert between :mod:`datetime`
    54	objects and Matplotlib dates:
    55	
    56	.. currentmodule:: matplotlib.dates
    57	
    58	.. autosummary::
    59	   :nosignatures:
    60	
    61	   datestr2num
    62	   date2num
    63	   num2date
    64	   num2timedelta
    65	   drange
    66	   set_epoch
    67	   get_epoch
    68	
    69	.. note::
    70	
    71	   Like Python's `datetime.datetime`, Matplotlib uses the Gregorian calendar
    72	   for all conversions between dates and floating point numbers. This practice
    73	   is not universal, and calendar differences can cause confusing
    74	   differences between what Python and Matplotlib give as the number of days
    75	   since 0001-01-01 and what other software and databases yield.  For
    76	   example, the US Naval Observatory uses a calendar that switches
    77	   from Julian to Gregorian in October, 1582.  Hence, using their
    78	   calculator, the number of days between 0001-01-01 and 2006-04-01 is
    79	   732403, whereas using the Gregorian calendar via the datetime
    80	   module we find::
    81	
    82	     In [1]: date(2006, 4, 1).toordinal() - date(1, 1, 1).toordinal()
    83	     Out[1]: 732401
    84	
    85	All the Matplotlib date converters, tickers and formatters are timezone aware.
    86	If no explicit timezone is provided, :rc:`timezone` is assumed, provided as a
    87	string.  If you want to use a different timezone, pass the *tz* keyword
    88	argument of `num2date` to any date tickers or locators you create.  This can
    89	be either a `datetime.tzinfo` instance or a string with the timezone name that
    90	can be parsed by `~dateutil.tz.gettz`.
    91	
    92	A wide range of specific and general purpose date tick locators and
    93	formatters are provided in this module.  See
    94	:mod:`matplotlib.ticker` for general information on tick locators
    95	and formatters.  These are described below.
    96	
    97	The dateutil_ module provides additional code to handle date ticking, making it
    98	easy to place ticks on any kinds of dates.  See examples below.

   101	
   102	Date tickers
   103	------------
   104	
   105	Most of the date tickers can locate single or multiple values.  For example::
   106	
   107	    # import constants for the days of the week
   108	    from matplotlib.dates import MO, TU, WE, TH, FR, SA, SU
   109	
   110	    # tick on mondays every week
   111	    loc = WeekdayLocator(byweekday=MO, tz=tz)
   112	
   113	    # tick on mondays and saturdays
   114	    loc = WeekdayLocator(byweekday=(MO, SA))
   115	
   116	In addition, most of the constructors take an interval argument::
   117	
   118	    # tick on mondays every second week
   119	    loc = WeekdayLocator(byweekday=MO, interval=2)
   120	
   121	The rrule locator allows completely general date ticking::
   122	
   123	    # tick every 5th easter
   124	    rule = rrulewrapper(YEARLY, byeaster=1, interval=5)
   125	    loc = RRuleLocator(rule)
   126	
   127	The available date tickers are:
   128	
   129	* `MicrosecondLocator`: Locate microseconds.
   130	
   131	* `SecondLocator`: Locate seconds.
   132	
   133	* `MinuteLocator`: Locate minutes.
   134	
   135	* `HourLocator`: Locate hours.
   136	
   137	* `DayLocator`: Locate specified days of the month.
   138	
   139	* `WeekdayLocator`: Locate days of the week, e.g., MO, TU.
   140	
   141	* `MonthLocator`: Locate months, e.g., 7 for July.
   142	
   143	* `YearLocator`: Locate years that are multiples of base.
   144	
   145	* `RRuleLocator`: Locate using a ``matplotlib.dates.rrulewrapper``.
   146	  ``rrulewrapper`` is a simple wrapper around dateutil_'s `dateutil.rrule`
   147	  which allow almost arbitrary date tick specifications.
   148	  See :doc:`rrule example </gallery/ticks/date_demo_rrule>`.
   149	
   150	* `AutoDateLocator`: On autoscale, this class picks the best `DateLocator`
   151	  (e.g., `RRuleLocator`) to set the view limits and the tick locations.  If
   152	  called with ``interval_multiples=True`` it will make ticks line up with
   153	  sensible multiples of the tick intervals.  E.g. if the interval is 4 hours,
   154	  it will pick hours 0, 4, 8, etc as ticks.  This behaviour is not guaranteed
   155	  by default.
   156	
   157	Date formatters
   158	---------------
   159	
   160	The available date formatters are:
   161	
   162	* `AutoDateFormatter`: attempts to figure out the best format to use.  This is
   163	  most useful when used with the `AutoDateLocator`.
   164	
   165	* `ConciseDateFormatter`: also attempts to figure out the best format to use,
   166	  and to make the format as compact as possible while still having complete
   167	  date information.  This is most useful when used with the `AutoDateLocator`.
   168	
   169	* `DateFormatter`: use `~datetime.datetime.strftime` format strings.
