Instead, you should explore the file system to find the file before working on it.\n* When configuring git credentials, use \"openhands\" as the user.name and \"openhands@all-hands.dev\" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* The assistant MUST NOT include comments in the code unless they are necessary to describe non-obvious behavior.\n</IMPORTANT>\nYou have access to the following functions:\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #1: execute_bash ----\nDescription: Execute a bash command in the terminal.\n* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, it should be run in the background and the output should be redirected to a file, e.g. command = `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`.\n* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, the assistant can interact with the running process and send empty `command` to retrieve any additional logs, or send additional text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process, or send command like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process.\n* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty string to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the currently running process. Note: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n  (2) is_input (string, optional): If True, the command is an input to the running process. If False, the command is a bash command to be executed in the terminal. Default is False.\nAllowed values: [`true`, `false`]\n---- END FUNCTION #1 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: finish ----\nDescription: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.\nNo parameters are required for this function.\n---- END FUNCTION #2 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----\nDescription: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files in plain-text format\n* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user\n* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n\nNotes for using the `str_replace` command:\n* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!\n* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique\n* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\nAllowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]\n  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/workspace/file.py` or `/workspace`.\n  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\n  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\n  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.\n  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.\n  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.\n---- END FUNCTION #3 ----\n\n\nIf you choose to call a function ONLY reply in the following format with NO suffix:\n\n<function=example_function_name>\n<parameter=example_parameter_1>value_1</parameter>\n<parameter=example_parameter_2>\nThis is the value for the second parameter\nthat can span\nmultiple lines\n</parameter>\n</function>\n\n<IMPORTANT>\nReminder:\n- Function calls MUST follow the specified format, start with <function= and end with </function>\n- Required parameters MUST be specified\n- Only call one function at a time\n- You may provide optional reasoning for your function call in natural language BEFORE the function call, but NOT after.\n- If there is no function call available, answer the question like normal with your current knowledge and do not tell the user about function calls\n</IMPORTANT>\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Here's a running example of how to perform a task with the provided tools.\n\n--------------------- START OF EXAMPLE ---------------------\n\nUSER: Create a list of numbers from 1 to 10, and display them in a web page at port 5000.\n\nASSISTANT: Sure!

AFTER REASONING, EMIT ONE AND ONLY ONE FUNCTION CALL PER MESSAGE.\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, let's tackle this issue. So, the problem is that when running pytest with xdist, the exception serialization doesn't include the chained exceptions, whereas without xdist, it does. The user wants the same detailed exception trace when using xdist as when not using it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how pytest handles exception serialization, especially when using xdist. Since xdist distributes tests across multiple workers, the exceptions need to be serialized and sent back to the main process. It seems that the current serialization process isn't capturing the chained exceptions properly.\n\nThe issue description mentions that in the non-xdist case, the full chain is displayed, but with xdist, only the last exception is shown. So, the problem is likely in how the exceptions are being serialized and deserialized when using xdist.\n\nI should start by looking into the pytest source code, particularly the parts that handle exception serialization and deserialization. Since the user has uploaded the pytest repository in the directory pytest-dev__pytest__5.1, I need to navigate through that codebase to find the relevant files.\n\nFirst, I'll explore the repository structure to find where exceptions are handled. The pytest framework has a lot of components, so I need to narrow down the possible locations. The key areas might be in the `_pytest` package, possibly under `terminal`, `runner`, or `node` modules, since those deal with test execution and reporting.\n\nAnother approach is to look for code related to exception serialization. Pytest uses some form of serialization to pass exceptions between processes when using xdist. This could involve pickling or a custom serialization method. If the current serialization doesn't capture the chained exceptions, then the code responsible for that needs to be modified.\n\nLet me start by checking the pytest-xdist plugin code. Since xdist is a separate plugin, the issue might be in how it handles exceptions. The xdist plugin is part of the pytest-xdist package, but since the user has uploaded the pytest repository, perhaps the xdist code is included here or needs to be integrated.\n\nWait, the user mentioned that the repository is pytest-dev__pytest__5.1, which is likely the pytest repository at version 5.1. So, the xdist plugin might be a separate repository, but perhaps the user has included it in the workspace. I need to check the directory structure.\n\nFirst, I should list the contents of the workspace to see what's there. Let's execute a command to list the files in the workspace.\n\n<function=execute_bash>\n<parameter=command>ls -R /workspace/pytest-dev__pytest__5.1</parameter>\n</function>"}, {"role": "user",

The main code for pytest is under the `src` directory, specifically in `src/_pytest`. The `testing` directory contains various test cases, but the user mentioned that the test files have already been taken care of, so I don't need to modify those.\n\nThe issue is about exception serialization when using xdist. Since xdist is a separate plugin, I need to check if the xdist code is included in this repository. However, the user mentioned that they've uploaded the pytest repository, so xdist might be a separate dependency. But given that the user has provided the pytest repository, perhaps the xdist code is not included here. Wait, but the user said they've uploaded the repository in the directory `pytest-dev__pytest__5.1`, which is likely the pytest repository itself. So xdist is a separate plugin, but maybe the user expects me to modify the pytest code to handle this issue when used with xdist.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem lies in how pytest serializes exceptions, and xdist relies on that serialization. So even if xdist is a separate plugin, the core pytest code might need to be adjusted to properly serialize chained exceptions.\n\nGiven that, I should look into the pytest code that handles exception serialization. When using xdist, exceptions are likely pickled and sent between processes. If the current pickling process doesn't capture the chained exceptions, then the code responsible for pickling the exceptions needs to be modified.\n\nIn Python, exceptions can have a `__cause__` attribute for chained exceptions (using `from`), and a `__context__` attribute for the previous exception in the chain (even without `from`). So, when serializing an exception, we need to capture these attributes to reconstruct the full chain.\n\nLooking at the pytest code, the `pytest` package has a `src/_pytest` directory. Let's see if there's any code related to exception handling or serialization. For example, the `pytest` runner or the `pytest` node code might be involved.\n\nAnother approach is to look for code that deals with reporting exceptions. The `terminal.py` file in `src/_pytest` might be responsible for displaying the exception trace. However, since the issue is about xdist, which distributes tests across multiple processes, the problem is likely in how exceptions are serialized and deserialized between the worker processes and the main process.\n\nIn xdist, each worker process runs tests and sends the results back to the main process. The results include information about test outcomes, including exceptions. If the exception is not properly serialized, the main process won't have access to the full chain.\n\nSo, the key is to find where in the pytest code exceptions are being serialized and ensure that the `__cause__` and `__context__` attributes are included in the serialization.\n\nLet me look for code that handles exception serialization. Perhaps in the `pytest` code, there's a function that converts exceptions into a format that can be sent over the wire (e.g., via pickle). I need to find where this conversion happens.\n\nLooking through the `src/_pytest` directory, there's a `node.py` file. Let me check that.\n\n<function=str_replace_editor>\n<parameter=command>view</parameter>\n<parameter=path>/workspace/pytest-dev__pytest__5.1/src/_pytest/node.py</parameter>\n</function>"}, {"role": "user", "content": "EXECUTION RESULT of [str_replace_editor]:\nERROR:\nInvalid `path` parameter: /workspace/pytest-dev__pytest__5.1/src/_pytest/node.py.

This method is part of the `Node` class and is responsible for generating the string representation of an exception for display purposes.\n\nHowever, this method is more about formatting the exception for the terminal report, not necessarily about serializing the exception for transmission between processes. Since the issue is related to xdist, which distributes tests across multiple processes, the problem is likely in how exceptions are serialized when sent from the worker processes back to the main process.\n\nIn xdist, each worker process runs tests and sends the results back to the main process. The results include information about test outcomes, including exceptions. If the exception is not properly serialized, the main process won't have access to the full chain of exceptions.\n\nSo, the key is to find where in the pytest code exceptions are being serialized and ensure that the `__cause__` and `__context__` attributes are included in the serialization.\n\nAnother possible location is in the `pytester.py` file, which is part of the testing infrastructure. But perhaps the actual serialization code is in the xdist plugin itself. Since the user has provided the pytest repository, but not xdist, I need to consider that the xdist plugin is a separate codebase. However, since the user has mentioned that the issue occurs when using xdist, the problem might be in how pytest's exception handling interacts with xdist's serialization.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is in how pytest captures exceptions and stores them in the test report.

This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /workspace directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.\n", "role": "user"}, {"content": "Okay, let's tackle this issue. So, the problem is that when running pytest with xdist, the exception serialization doesn't include the chained exceptions, whereas without xdist, it does. The user wants the same detailed exception trace when using xdist as when not using it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how pytest handles exception serialization, especially when using xdist. Since xdist distributes tests across multiple workers, the exceptions need to be serialized and sent back to the main process. It seems that the current serialization process isn't capturing the chained exceptions properly.\n\nThe issue description mentions that in the non-xdist case, the full chain is displayed, but with xdist, only the last exception is shown. So, the problem is likely in how the exceptions are being serialized and deserialized when using xdist.\n\nI should start by looking into the pytest source code, particularly the parts that handle exception serialization and deserialization. Since the user has uploaded the pytest repository in the directory pytest-dev__pytest__5.1, I need to navigate through that codebase to find the relevant files.\n\nFirst, I'll explore the repository structure to find where exceptions are handled. The pytest framework has a lot of components, so I need to narrow down the possible locations. The key areas might be in the `_pytest` package, possibly under `terminal`, `runner`, or `node` modules, since those deal with test execution and reporting.\n\nAnother approach is to look for code related to exception serialization. Pytest uses some form of serialization to pass exceptions between processes when using xdist. This could involve pickling or a custom serialization method. If the current serialization doesn't capture the chained exceptions, then the code responsible for that needs to be modified.\n\nLet me start by checking the pytest-xdist plugin code. Since xdist is a separate plugin, the issue might be in how it handles exceptions. The xdist plugin is part of the pytest-xdist package, but since the user has uploaded the pytest repository, perhaps the xdist code is included here or needs to be integrated.\n\nWait, the user mentioned that the repository is pytest-dev__pytest__5.1, which is likely the pytest repository at version 5.1. So, the xdist plugin might be a separate repository, but perhaps the user has included it in the workspace. I need to check the directory structure.\n\nFirst, I should list the contents of the workspace to see what's there.

is quite extensive. The main code for pytest is under the `src` directory, specifically in `src/_pytest`. The `testing` directory contains various test cases, but the user mentioned that the test files have already been taken care of, so I don't need to modify those.\n\nThe issue is about exception serialization when using xdist. Since xdist is a separate plugin, I need to check if the xdist code is included in this repository. However, the user mentioned that they've uploaded the pytest repository, so xdist might be a separate dependency. But given that the user has provided the pytest repository, perhaps the xdist code is not included here. Wait, but the user said they've uploaded the repository in the directory `pytest-dev__pytest__5.1`, which is likely the pytest repository itself. So xdist is a separate plugin, but maybe the user expects me to modify the pytest code to handle this issue when used with xdist.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem lies in how pytest serializes exceptions, and xdist relies on that serialization. So even if xdist is a separate plugin, the core pytest code might need to be adjusted to properly serialize chained exceptions.\n\nGiven that, I should look into the pytest code that handles exception serialization. When using xdist, exceptions are likely pickled and sent between processes. If the current pickling process doesn't capture the chained exceptions, then the code responsible for pickling the exceptions needs to be modified.\n\nIn Python, exceptions can have a `__cause__` attribute for chained exceptions (using `from`), and a `__context__` attribute for the previous exception in the chain (even without `from`). So, when serializing an exception, we need to capture these attributes to reconstruct the full chain.\n\nLooking at the pytest code, the `pytest` package has a `src/_pytest` directory. Let's see if there's any code related to exception handling or serialization. For example, the `pytest` runner or the `pytest` node code might be involved.\n\nAnother approach is to look for code that deals with reporting exceptions. The `terminal.py` file in `src/_pytest` might be responsible for displaying the exception trace. However, since the issue is about xdist, which distributes tests across multiple processes, the problem is likely in how exceptions are serialized and deserialized between the worker processes and the main process.\n\nIn xdist, each worker process runs tests and sends the results back to the main process. The results include information about test outcomes, including exceptions. If the exception is not properly serialized, the main process won't have access to the full chain.\n\nSo, the key is to find where in the pytest code exceptions are being serialized and ensure that the `__cause__` and `__context__` attributes are included in the serialization.\n\nLet me look for code that handles exception serialization. Perhaps in the `pytest` code, there's a function that converts exceptions into a format that can be sent over the wire (e.g., via pickle). I need to find where this conversion happens.\n\nLooking through the `src/_pytest` directory, there's a `node.py` file.

This method is part of the `Node` class and is responsible for generating the string representation of an exception for display purposes.\n\nHowever, this method is more about formatting the exception for the terminal report, not necessarily about serializing the exception for transmission between processes. Since the issue is related to xdist, which distributes tests across multiple processes, the problem is likely in how exceptions are serialized when sent from the worker processes back to the main process.\n\nIn xdist, each worker process runs tests and sends the results back to the main process. The results include information about test outcomes, including exceptions. If the exception is not properly serialized, the main process won't have access to the full chain of exceptions.\n\nSo, the key is to find where in the pytest code exceptions are being serialized and ensure that the `__cause__` and `__context__` attributes are included in the serialization.\n\nAnother possible location is in the `pytester.py` file, which is part of the testing infrastructure. But perhaps the actual serialization code is in the xdist plugin itself. Since the user has provided the pytest repository, but not xdist, I need to consider that the xdist plugin is a separate codebase. However, since the user has mentioned that the issue occurs when using xdist, the problem might be in how pytest's exception handling interacts with xdist's serialization.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is in how pytest captures exceptions and stores them in the test report. The `reports.py` file might be relevant here.\n\nLet me check the `reports.py` file.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"index": 1, "function": {"arguments": "{\"command\": \"view\", \"path\": \"/workspace/pytest-dev__pytest__5.1/src/_pytest/reports.py\"}", "name": "str_replace_editor"}, "id": "toolu_04", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 385, "prompt_tokens": 15028, "total_tokens": 15413, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_logprobs": null}}
