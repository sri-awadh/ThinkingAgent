By setting `is_input` to `true`, the assistant can interact with the running process and send empty `command` to retrieve any additional logs, or send additional text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process, or send command like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process.\n* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty string to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the currently running process. Note: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n  (2) is_input (string, optional): If True, the command is an input to the running process. If False, the command is a bash command to be executed in the terminal. Default is False.\nAllowed values: [`true`, `false`]\n---- END FUNCTION #1 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: finish ----\nDescription: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.\nNo parameters are required for this function.\n---- END FUNCTION #2 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----\nDescription: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files in plain-text format\n* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user\n* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n\nNotes for using the `str_replace` command:\n* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!\n* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique\n* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run.

Please describe.**\r\nCurrently, if I'm using autodoc, the `:private-members:` option does not allow specification of which private members to document. The current behavior is to document all private members, but what if I would only like to document 1 or 2?\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nFor `:private-members:` to take arguments, similarly to how `:members:` currently works\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThe current best way to do this is to explicitly list each class in a module and use `:autoattribute:`\r\n\r\n- Some prior discussion: https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/8009\r\n\r\n\n\n</issue_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <issue_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /workspace directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.\n\n--------------------- END OF NEW TASK DESCRIPTION --------------------- \n\nREASON AS MUCH AS NEEDED, BUT RESPECT THE FORMAT STRICTLY! AFTER REASONING, EMIT ONE AND ONLY ONE FUNCTION CALL PER MESSAGE.\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, let's tackle this issue. The problem is that currently, when using the `:private-members:` option in Sphinx's autodoc, it documents all private members (those starting with an underscore) of a module or class. The user wants to be able to specify which private members to document, similar to how the `:members:` option works where you can list specific members to include.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the autodoc extension in Sphinx works. The autodoc extension is responsible for automatically generating documentation from docstrings and other code elements. The `:private-members:` option is part of the directives used in the documentation to include private members.\n\nLooking at the issue description, the user suggests that the `:private-members:` option should take arguments, similar to `:members:`, which allows specifying individual members to include. So, the goal is to modify the autodoc code to parse the `:private-members:` option in a way that allows specifying specific private members to document, rather than including all of them.\n\nTo start, I should explore the repository structure to find where the autodoc directives are defined. The repository is in the directory `sphinx-doc__sphinx__3.2`, which is likely a version of the Sphinx project. I need to find the relevant files that handle the autodoc directives.\n\nFirst, I'll check the directory structure to see where the autodoc code is located. Typically, in Sphinx, the autodoc extension is in the `sphinx/ext/autodoc` directory. So, I'll navigate to that directory and look for the files that define the directives.\n\nOnce I find the relevant files, I need to locate the part of the code that handles the `:private-members:` option. This is probably in the directive's option handling code. The `:private-members:` option is a boolean flag that, when set, includes all private members. The user wants to modify this so that it can take a list of specific private members to include.\n\nSo, the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. **Identify the code that processes the `:private-members:` option.**\n2. **Modify the code to accept a list of private members to include, similar to `:members:`.**\n3. **Update the documentation to reflect this new functionality.**\n4. **Ensure that the existing tests (which you've already handled) pass.**\n\nLet me start by exploring the repository structure. I'll use the `execute_bash` function to list the contents of the `sphinx-doc__sphinx__3.2` directory.\n\n<function=execute_bash>\n<parameter=command>ls /workspace/sphinx-doc__sphinx__3.2</parameter>\n</function>"}, {"role": "user", "content": "EXECUTION RESULT of [execute_bash]:\nAUTHORS  CHANGES  CHANGES.old  CODE_OF_CONDUCT  CONTRIBUTING.rst  EXAMPLES  LICENSE  MANIFEST.in  Makefile  README.rst  Sphinx.egg-info  babel.cfg  bindep.txt  doc  karma.conf.js  package-lock.json  package.json  setup.cfg  setup.py  sphinx  tests  tox.ini  utils\n[The command completed with exit code 0.]\n[Current working directory: /workspace/sphinx-doc__sphinx__3.2]\n[Python interpreter: /opt/miniconda3/envs/testbed/bin/python]\n[Command finished with exit code 0]"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, so the repository contains several directories and files.

As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.\n", "role": "user"}, {"content": "Okay, let's tackle this issue. The problem is that currently, when using the `:private-members:` option in Sphinx's autodoc, it documents all private members (those starting with an underscore) of a module or class. The user wants to be able to specify which private members to document, similar to how the `:members:` option works where you can list specific members to include.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the autodoc extension in Sphinx works. The autodoc extension is responsible for automatically generating documentation from docstrings and other code elements. The `:private-members:` option is part of the directives used in the documentation to include private members.\n\nLooking at the issue description, the user suggests that the `:private-members:` option should take arguments, similar to `:members:`, which allows specifying individual members to include. So, the goal is to modify the autodoc code to parse the `:private-members:` option in a way that allows specifying specific private members to document, rather than including all of them.\n\nTo start, I should explore the repository structure to find where the autodoc directives are defined. The repository is in the directory `sphinx-doc__sphinx__3.2`, which is likely a version of the Sphinx project. I need to find the relevant files that handle the autodoc directives.\n\nFirst, I'll check the directory structure to see where the autodoc code is located. Typically, in Sphinx, the autodoc extension is in the `sphinx/ext/autodoc` directory. So, I'll navigate to that directory and look for the files that define the directives.\n\nOnce I find the relevant files, I need to locate the part of the code that handles the `:private-members:` option. This is probably in the directive's option handling code. The `:private-members:` option is a boolean flag that, when set, includes all private members. The user wants to modify this so that it can take a list of specific private members to include.\n\nSo, the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. **Identify the code that processes the `:private-members:` option.**\n2. **Modify the code to accept a list of private members to include, similar to `:members:`.**\n3. **Update the documentation to reflect this new functionality.**\n4. **Ensure that the existing tests (which you've already handled) pass.**\n\nLet me start by exploring the repository structure.
