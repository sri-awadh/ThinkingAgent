By setting `is_input` to `true`, the assistant can interact with the running process and send empty `command` to retrieve any additional logs, or send additional text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process, or send command like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process.\n* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty string to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the currently running process. Note: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n  (2) is_input (string, optional): If True, the command is an input to the running process.

Consider the following issue description:\n\n<issue_description>\nSet default FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION to 0o644.\nDescription\n\t\nHello,\nAs far as I can see, the \u200bFile Uploads documentation page does not mention any permission issues.\nWhat I would like to see is a warning that in absence of explicitly configured FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS, the permissions for a file uploaded to FileSystemStorage might not be consistent depending on whether a MemoryUploadedFile or a TemporaryUploadedFile was used for temporary storage of the uploaded data (which, with the default FILE_UPLOAD_HANDLERS, in turn depends on the uploaded data size).\nThe tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile + os.rename sequence causes the resulting file permissions to be 0o0600 on some systems (I experience it here on CentOS 7.4.1708 and Python 3.6.5). In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue \u200bon GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n\n</issue_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <issue_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /workspace directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.\n\n--------------------- END OF NEW TASK DESCRIPTION --------------------- \n\nREASON AS MUCH AS NEEDED, BUT RESPECT THE FORMAT STRICTLY! AFTER REASONING, EMIT ONE AND ONLY ONE FUNCTION CALL PER MESSAGE.\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, let's tackle this issue. The problem is about the default file permissions when uploading files in Django. The current behavior seems to set permissions to 0o0600, which is a security measure, but the user wants to change the default FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS to 0o644. \n\nFirst, I need to understand where Django handles file uploads and how the permissions are set. From what I remember, Django uses FileSystemStorage for storing uploaded files, and the permissions are determined by the FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS setting. If this setting isn't specified, Django might use some default behavior, which in this case is leading to 0o0600 permissions.\n\nThe issue mentions that the problem occurs when using MemoryUploadedFile or TemporaryUploadedFile, which are part of the upload handlers. Depending on the file size, Django might use one or the other. The tempfile module is involved here, and it seems that when using NamedTemporaryFile, the permissions are set to 0o0600. Then, when the file is renamed, those permissions are retained.\n\nSo, the goal is to set the default FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS to 0o644. This should ensure that all uploaded files have the correct permissions, regardless of the upload handler used.\n\nFirst, I need to find where in the Django codebase the FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS setting is handled. I think this is in the FileSystemStorage class. Let me check the Django documentation or the source code.\n\nLooking at the Django documentation for FileSystemStorage, it mentions that the permissions can be set via the upload_permissions mode. The default is None, which means that the system's default umask is used. But the user wants to set it to 0o644 by default.\n\nSo, the plan is to modify the default value of FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS in Django's settings. However, since this is a default setting, it's probably defined in the django.conf.settings module. I need to find where this default is set.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the default is set in the FileSystemStorage class. Let me check the source code.\n\nI'll start by exploring the repository structure.

In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue \u200bon GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n\n</issue_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <issue_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>.

As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4.

Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.\n", "role": "user"}, {"content": "Okay, let's tackle this issue. The problem is about the default file permissions when uploading files in Django. The current behavior seems to set permissions to 0o0600, which is a security measure, but the user wants to change the default FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS to 0o644. \n\nFirst, I need to understand where Django handles file uploads and how the permissions are set. From what I remember, Django uses FileSystemStorage for storing uploaded files, and the permissions are determined by the FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS setting. If this setting isn't specified, Django might use some default behavior, which in this case is leading to 0o0600 permissions.\n\nThe issue mentions that the problem occurs when using MemoryUploadedFile or TemporaryUploadedFile, which are part of the upload handlers. Depending on the file size, Django might use one or the other. The tempfile module is involved here, and it seems that when using NamedTemporaryFile, the permissions are set to 0o0600. Then, when the file is renamed, those permissions are retained.\n\nSo, the goal is to set the default FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS to 0o644. This should ensure that all uploaded files have the correct permissions, regardless of the upload handler used.\n\nFirst, I need to find where in the Django codebase the FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS setting is handled. I think this is in the FileSystemStorage class. Let me check the Django documentation or the source code.\n\nLooking at the Django documentation for FileSystemStorage, it mentions that the permissions can be set via the upload_permissions mode. The default is None, which means that the system's default umask is used. But the user wants to set it to 0o644 by default.\n\nSo, the plan is to modify the default value of FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS in Django's settings. However, since this is a default setting, it's probably defined in the django.conf.settings module. I need to find where this default is set.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the default is set in the FileSystemStorage class. Let me check the source code.\n\nI'll start by exploring the repository structure.
