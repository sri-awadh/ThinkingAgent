Consider the following issue description:\n\n<issue_description>\nIn v5.3, NDDataRef mask propagation fails when one of the operand does not have a mask\n### Description\n\nThis applies to v5.3. \r\n\r\nIt looks like when one of the operand does not have a mask, the mask propagation when doing arithmetic, in particular with `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or` fails.  This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.  Or whatever was done in that situation in v5.2 where there's no problem.\n\n### How to Reproduce\n\nThis is with v5.3.

AFTER REASONING, EMIT ONE AND ONLY ONE FUNCTION CALL PER MESSAGE.\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, let's tackle this issue. So, the problem is that in astropy version 5.3, when performing arithmetic operations with NDDataRef objects where one of the operands doesn't have a mask, the mask propagation using handle_mask=np.bitwise_or fails with a TypeError. The error occurs because the bitwise_or operation is trying to combine an integer and a NoneType, which isn't allowed. In version 5.2, this worked fine, so the change must have happened in the code between these versions.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how NDDataRef handles masks during arithmetic operations. The issue seems to be in the mask propagation logic, specifically when one operand has a mask and the other doesn't. The handle_mask parameter is set to np.bitwise_or, which is supposed to combine the masks of the two operands. However, when one operand's mask is None, this causes a problem.\n\nSo, the goal is to modify the code so that when one operand has a mask and the other doesn't, the existing mask is propagated correctly without causing a TypeError. The expected behavior is that if one operand has a mask and the other doesn't, the mask from the operand that has it should be used in the result.\n\nTo start, I should look into the NDDataRef class and the arithmetic methods (like multiply) to see how masks are handled. The error occurs during the multiply operation, so I need to find where the mask combination is happening and adjust it to handle None values properly.\n\nLet me first explore the repository structure to find the relevant files. The uploaded directory is astropy__astropy__5.2, which is the version 5.2 codebase. But the issue is in version 5.3, so perhaps the code in the repository has been updated since then. Wait, the user mentioned that the code repository is in the directory astropy__astropy__5.2, but the issue is in v5.3. Hmm, maybe the code in the repository is the current version (5.3) where the bug exists, and we need to fix it. Or perhaps the user uploaded the code from v5.2, but the issue is in v5.3. This is a bit confusing. Let me check the repository's version.\n\nWait, the user said they've uploaded a Python code repository in the directory astropy__astropy__5.2. So perhaps that's the code for version 5.2, but the issue is in version 5.3. So maybe the code in the repository is the current version (5.3) where the bug exists, and we need to fix it. But the user mentioned that the code is in the directory astropy__astropy__5.2. That's a bit confusing. Maybe the directory name is just a label, and the actual code is from version 5.3. Alternatively, perhaps the code is from version 5.2, and the user wants to apply the fix to bring it up to version 5.3. But the issue description says the problem is in v5.3, so perhaps the code in the repository is the current version (5.3) where the bug exists, and we need to fix it.\n\nWait, the user says they've uploaded the code repository in the directory astropy__astropy__5.2.

The NDDataRef class is defined in astropy/nddata/nddata_withmixins.py. It's a subclass of NDArithmeticMixin, NDIOMixin, NDSlicingMixin, and NDData. The arithmetic operations are likely handled by the NDArithmeticMixin.\n\nThe issue is related to mask propagation during arithmetic operations, specifically when one operand has a mask and the other doesn't. The error occurs when using handle_mask=np.bitwise_or, which tries to combine the masks using bitwise_or but fails when one mask is None.\n\nSo, the problem is in the mask combination logic within the NDArithmeticMixin.

The _arithmetic method is where the mask handling logic is implemented. Specifically, the mask handling is done in the section where handle_mask is processed.\n\nLooking at the code, when handle_mask is not None, the code checks if the result has a mask attribute (which would be the case if using numpy.ma or astropy.utils.masked). If not, it proceeds to handle the mask based on the handle_mask parameter.\n\nIn the case where handle_mask is a callable (like np.bitwise_or), the code calls self._arithmetic_mask with the operation, operand, handle_mask, and any additional keyword arguments.\n\nThe error occurs when one operand has a mask and the other doesn't. The handle_mask function (np.bitwise_or) is called with the masks of the two operands. However, if one of the masks is None, this leads to a TypeError because you can't perform a bitwise_or between an integer and None.\n\nSo, the problem is in the _arithmetic_mask method, which is responsible for combining the masks. Let's check the code for _arithmetic_mask.\n\nLooking at the code, the _arithmetic_mask method is not defined in the provided snippet.

This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.

As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.\n2.

Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.\n", "role": "user"}, {"content": "Okay, let's tackle this issue. So, the problem is that in astropy version 5.3, when performing arithmetic operations with NDDataRef objects where one of the operands doesn't have a mask, the mask propagation using handle_mask=np.bitwise_or fails with a TypeError. The error occurs because the bitwise_or operation is trying to combine an integer and a NoneType, which isn't allowed. In version 5.2, this worked fine, so the change must have happened in the code between these versions.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how NDDataRef handles masks during arithmetic operations. The issue seems to be in the mask propagation logic, specifically when one operand has a mask and the other doesn't. The handle_mask parameter is set to np.bitwise_or, which is supposed to combine the masks of the two operands. However, when one operand's mask is None, this causes a problem.\n\nSo, the goal is to modify the code so that when one operand has a mask and the other doesn't, the existing mask is propagated correctly without causing a TypeError. The expected behavior is that if one operand has a mask and the other doesn't, the mask from the operand that has it should be used in the result.\n\nTo start, I should look into the NDDataRef class and the arithmetic methods (like multiply) to see how masks are handled. The error occurs during the multiply operation, so I need to find where the mask combination is happening and adjust it to handle None values properly.\n\nLet me first explore the repository structure to find the relevant files. The uploaded directory is astropy__astropy__5.2, which is the version 5.2 codebase. But the issue is in version 5.3, so perhaps the code in the repository has been updated since then. Wait, the user mentioned that the code repository is in the directory astropy__astropy__5.2, but the issue is in v5.3. Hmm, maybe the code in the repository is the current version (5.3) where the bug exists, and we need to fix it. Or perhaps the user uploaded the code from v5.2, but the issue is in v5.3. This is a bit confusing. Let me check the repository's version.\n\nWait, the user said they've uploaded a Python code repository in the directory astropy__astropy__5.2. So perhaps that's the code for version 5.2, but the issue is in version 5.3. So maybe the code in the repository is the current version (5.3) where the bug exists, and we need to fix it. But the user mentioned that the code is in the directory astropy__astropy__5.2. That's a bit confusing. Maybe the directory name is just a label, and the actual code is from version 5.3. Alternatively, perhaps the code is from version 5.2, and the user wants to apply the fix to bring it up to version 5.3. But the issue description says the problem is in v5.3, so perhaps the code in the repository is the current version (5.3) where the bug exists, and we need to fix it.\n\nWait, the user says they've uploaded the code repository in the directory astropy__astropy__5.2.

The _arithmetic method is where the mask handling logic is implemented. Specifically, the mask handling is done in the section where handle_mask is processed.\n\nLooking at the code, when handle_mask is not None, the code checks if the result has a mask attribute (which would be the case if using numpy.ma or astropy.utils.masked). If not, it proceeds to handle the mask based on the handle_mask parameter.\n\nIn the case where handle_mask is a callable (like np.bitwise_or), the code calls self._arithmetic_mask with the operation, operand, handle_mask, and any additional keyword arguments.\n\nThe error occurs when one operand has a mask and the other doesn't. The handle_mask function (np.bitwise_or) is called with the masks of the two operands. However, if one of the masks is None, this leads to a TypeError because you can't perform a bitwise_or between an integer and None.\n\nSo, the problem is in the _arithmetic_mask method, which is responsible for combining the masks. Let's check the code for _arithmetic_mask.\n\nLooking at the code, the _arithmetic_mask method is not defined in the provided snippet.
