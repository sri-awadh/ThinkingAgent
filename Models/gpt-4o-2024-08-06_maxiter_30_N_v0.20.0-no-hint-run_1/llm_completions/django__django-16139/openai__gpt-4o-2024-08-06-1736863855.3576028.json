Consider the following PR description:\n\n<pr_description>\nAccessing UserAdmin via to_field leads to link to PasswordResetForm being broken (404)\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Simon Kern)\n\t \nAccessing the UserAdmin via another model's Admin that has a reference to User (with to_field set, e.g., to_field=\"uuid\") leads to the UserAdmin being accessed via an url that looks similar to this one:\n.../user/22222222-3333-4444-5555-666677778888/change/?_to_field=uuid\nHowever the underlying form looks like this: \nCode highlighting:\nclass UserChangeForm(forms.ModelForm):\n\tpassword = ReadOnlyPasswordHashField(\n\t\tlabel=_(\"Password\"),\n\t\thelp_text=_(\n\t\t\t\"Raw passwords are not stored, so there is no way to see this \"\n\t\t\t\"user\u2019s password, but you can change the password using \"\n\t\t\t'<a href=\"{}\">this form</a>.'\n\t\t),\n\t)\n\t...\n\t...\n\tdef __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n\t\tsuper().__init__(*args, **kwargs)\n\t\tpassword = self.fields.get(\"password\")\n\t\tif password:\n\t\t\tpassword.help_text = password.help_text.format(\"../password/\")\n\t...\n\t...\nThis results in the link to the PasswordResetForm being wrong and thus ending up in a 404. If we drop the assumption that UserAdmin is always accessed via its pk, then we're good to go. It's as simple as replacing password.help_text = password.help_text.format(\"../password/\") with password.help_text = password.help_text.format(f\"../../{self.instance.pk}/password/\")\nI've opened a pull request on GitHub for this Ticket, please see:\n\u200bPR\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /workspace directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.\n"}, {"type": "text", "text": "<extra_info>\nThe following information has been included based on a keyword match for \"github\".
