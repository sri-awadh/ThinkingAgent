+;; style file for xindy
+;; filename: LICRlatin2utf8.xdy
+;; description: style file for xindy which maps back LaTeX Internal
+;;   Character Representation of letters (as arising in .idx index
+;;   file) to UTF-8 encoding for correct sorting by xindy.
+;; usage: for use with the pdflatex engine,
+;;        *not* for use with xelatex or lualatex.
+;;
+;; This is based upon xindy's distributed file tex/inputenc/utf8.xdy.
+;; The modifications include:
+;;
+;; - Updates for compatibility with current LaTeX macro encoding.
+;;
+;; - Systematic usage of the \IeC {...} mark-up, because mark-up in
+;;   tex/inputenc/utf8.xdy was using it on seemingly random basis, and
+;;   Sphinx coercing of xindy usability for both Latin and Cyrillic scripts
+;;   with pdflatex requires its systematic presence here.
+;;
+;; - Support for some extra letters: Ÿ, Ŋ, ŋ, Œ, œ, Ĳ, ĳ, ȷ and ẞ.
+;;
+;;   Indeed Sphinx needs to support for pdflatex engine all Unicode letters
+;;   available in TeX T1 font encoding.  The above letters are found in
+;;   that encoding but not in the Latin1, 2, 3 charsets which are those
+;;   covered by original tex/inputenc/utf8.xdy.
+;;
+;; - There is a problem that ȷ is not supported out-of-the box by LaTeX
+;;   with inputenc, one must add explicitly
+;;       \DeclareUnicodeCharacter{0237}{\j}
+;;   to preamble of LaTeX document.  However this character is not supported
+;;   by the TeX "times" font used by default by Sphinx for pdflatex engine.
+;;
+;;     **Update**: since LaTeX 2018/12/01, the \j as well as \SS, \k{} and
+;;                  \.{} need no extra user declaration anymore.
+;;
+;; - ẞ needs \DeclareUnicodeCharacter{1E9E}{\SS} (but ß needs no extra set-up).
+;;
+;; - U+02DB (˛) and U+02D9 (˙) are also not supported by inputenc
+;;   out of the box and require
+;;       \DeclareUnicodeCharacter{02DB}{\k{}}
+;;       \DeclareUnicodeCharacter{02D9}{\.{}}
+;;   to be added to preamble.
+;;
+;; - U+0127 ħ and U+0126 Ħ are absent from TeX T1+TS1 font encodings.
+;;
+;; - Characters Ŋ and ŋ are not supported by TeX font "times" used by
+;;   default by Sphinx for pdflatex engine but they are supported by
+;;   some TeX fonts, in particular by the default LaTeX font for T1
+;;   encoding.
+;;
+;; - " and ~ must be escaped as ~" and resp. ~~ in xindy merge rules.
+;;

+% even if not needed if such files are replaced, the definition does no harm)
+\newif\ifspx@inframed
+%
+% \spx@ifcaptionpackage (defined at begin document)
+%     is needed currently in macros from:
+%     sphinxlatexliterals.sty (sphinxVerbatim)
+%     sphinxlatextables.sty   (for some macros used in the table templates)
+%
+% \sphinxcaption is mark-up injected by the tabular and tabulary templates
+%     it is defined in sphinxlatextables.sty
+%
+% store the original \caption macro for usage with figures inside longtable
+% and tabulary cells. Make sure we get the final \caption in presence of
+% caption package, whether the latter was loaded before or after sphinx.

+%
+% The "forced" line wrapping will parse the tokens to add potential
+% breakpoints at each character. As some strings are highlighted,

+% requires to manipulate the output of the Pygments LaTeXFormatter.
+%
+% Doing this at latex level is complicated. The contents should
+% be as expected: i.e. some active characters from
+% \sphinxbreaksviaactive, some Pygments character escapes such as
+% \PYGZdl{}, and the highlighting \PYG macro with always 2
+% arguments. No other macros should be there, except perhaps
+% zero-parameter macros. In particular:

+% The highlighting macro \PYG will be applied character per

+% box does not store in an accessible way what was the maximal
+% line-width during paragraph building.
+%
+% Avoid LaTeX 2021 alteration of \@@par which potentially could break our
+% measurement step (typically if the para/after hook is configured to use
+% \vspace).  Of course, breakage could happen only from user or package

+% cells rendered by tabular/longtable, and to allow multi-column cells with
+% paragraphs to be taken into account sanely by tabulary algorithm for column
+% widths.
+%
+% This requires quite a bit of hacking. First, in Sphinx, the multi-column
+% contents will *always* be wrapped in a varwidth environment. The issue
+% becomes to pass it the correct target width. We must trick tabulary into
+% believing the multicolumn is simply separate columns, else tabulary does not
+% incorporate the contents in its algorithm. But then we must clear the
+% vertical rules...
+%
+% configuration of tabulary
+\setlength{\tymin}{3\fontcharwd\font`0 }% minimal width of "squeezed" columns
+\setlength{\tymax}{10000pt}% allow enough room for paragraphs to "compete"
+% we need access to tabulary's final computed width. \@tempdima is too volatile
+% to hope it has kept tabulary's value when \sphinxcolwidth needs it.
+\newdimen\sphinx@TY@tablewidth
+\def\tabulary{%
+  \def\TY@final{\sphinx@TY@tablewidth\@tempdima\tabular}%
+  \let\endTY@final\endtabular
+  \TY@tabular}%
+% next hack is needed only if user has set latex_use_latex_multicolumn to True:
+% it fixes tabulary's bug with \multicolumn defined "short" in first pass. (if
+% upstream tabulary adds a \long, our extra one causes no harm)
+\def\sphinx@tempa #1\def\multicolumn#2#3#4#5#6#7#8#9\sphinx@tempa
+   {\def\TY@tab{#1\long\def\multicolumn####1####2####3{\multispan####1\relax}#9}}%
+\expandafter\sphinx@tempa\TY@tab\sphinx@tempa
+%
+% TN. 1: as \omit is never executed, Sphinx multicolumn does not need to worry
+% like standard multicolumn about |l| vs l|. On the other hand it assumes
+% columns are separated by a | ... (if not it will add extraneous
+% \arrayrulewidth space for each column separation in its estimate of available
+% width).
+%
+% TN. 1b: as Sphinx multicolumn uses neither \omit nor \span, it can not
+% (easily) get rid of extra macros from >{...} or <{...} between columns. At
+% least, it has been made compatible with colortbl's \columncolor.
+%
+% TN. 2: tabulary's second pass is handled like tabular/longtable's single
+% pass, with the difference that we hacked \TY@final to set in
+% \sphinx@TY@tablewidth the final target width as computed by tabulary. This is
+% needed only to handle columns with a "horizontal" specifier: "p" type columns
+% (inclusive of tabulary's LJRC) holds the target column width in the
+% \linewidth dimension.
+%
+% TN. 3: use of \begin{sphinxmulticolumn}...\end{sphinxmulticolumn} mark-up
+% would need some hacking around the fact that groups can not span across table
+% cells (the code does inserts & tokens, see TN1b). It was decided to keep it
+% simple with \sphinxstartmulticolumn...\sphinxstopmulticolumn.
+%
+% MEMO about nesting: if sphinxmulticolumn is encountered in a nested tabular
+% inside a tabulary it will think to be at top level in the tabulary. But
+% Sphinx generates no nested tables, and if some LaTeX macro uses internally a
+% tabular this will not have a \sphinxstartmulticolumn within it!

+% Now the branch handling either the second pass of tabulary or the single pass
+% of tabular/longtable. This is the delicate part where we gather the
+% dimensions from the p columns either set-up by tabulary or by user p column
+% or Sphinx \X, \Y columns. The difficulty is that to get the said width, the
+% template must be inserted (other hacks would be horribly complicated except
+% if we rewrote crucial parts of LaTeX's \@array !) and we can not do
+% \omit\span like standard \multicolumn's easy approach. Thus we must cancel
+% the \vrule separators. Also, perhaps the column specifier is of the l, c, r

+% --- MULTIROW ---
+% standard \multirow
+% 1. does not allow verbatim contents,
+% 2. does not allow blank lines in its argument,
+% 3. its * specifier means to typeset "horizontally" which is very
+%    bad for paragraph content. 2016 version has = specifier but it
+%    must be used with p type columns only, else results are bad,
+% 4. it requires manual intervention if the contents is too long to fit
+%    in the asked-for number of rows.
+% 5. colour panels (either from \rowcolor or \columncolor) will hide
+%    the bottom part of multirow text, hence manual tuning is needed
+%    to put the multirow insertion at the _bottom_.
+%
+% The Sphinx solution consists in always having contents wrapped
+% in a varwidth environment so that it makes sense to estimate how many
+% lines it will occupy, and then ensure by insertion of suitable struts
+% that the table rows have the needed height. The needed mark-up is done
+% by LaTeX writer, which has its own id for the merged cells.
+%
+% The colour issue is solved by clearing colour panels in all cells,
+% whether or not the multirow is single-column or multi-column.
+%
+% In passing we obtain baseline alignements across rows (only if
+% \arraystretch is 1, as LaTeX's does not obey \arraystretch in "p"
+% multi-line contents, only first and last line...)
+%
+% TODO: examine the situation with \arraystretch > 1. The \extrarowheight
+% is hopeless for multirow anyhow, it makes baseline alignment strictly
+% impossible.

+ [2022/02/12 v4.5.0 Sphinx custom footnotehyper package (Sphinx team)]
+%%
+%% Package: sphinxpackagefootnote
+%% Version: based on footnotehyper.sty 2021/02/04 v1.1d
+%%          https://www.ctan.org/pkg/footnotehyper
+%% License: the one applying to Sphinx
+%%
+% Provides support for footnote mark-up from Sphinx latex writer:
+% - "footnote" and "footnotetext"  environments allowing verbatim material
+% - "savenotes" environment for wrapping environments, such as for tables
+%   which have problems with LaTeX footnotes
+% - hyperlinks
+%
+% Sphinx uses exclusively this mark-up for footnotes:
+% - \begin{footnote}[N]
+% - \begin{footnotetext}[N]
+% - \sphinxfootnotemark[N]
+% where N is a number.
+%
+%% Some small differences from upstream footnotehyper.sty:
+%% - a tabulary compatibility layer (partial but enough for Sphinx),
+%% - usage of \spx@opt@BeforeFootnote
+%% - usage of \sphinxunactivateextrasandspace from sphinx.sty,
+%% - \sphinxlongtablepatch
+%%
+%% Starting with Sphinx v4.5.0, inherited footnotehyper macros for
+%% footnote/footnotetext receive some Sphinx specific extras to
+%% implement "intelligent" footnote marks checking page numbers.
+%%
+%% All footnotes output from Sphinx are hyperlinked. With "savenotes"
+%% footnotes may appear on page distinct from footnote mark, the latter
+%% will indicate page number of the footnote.
