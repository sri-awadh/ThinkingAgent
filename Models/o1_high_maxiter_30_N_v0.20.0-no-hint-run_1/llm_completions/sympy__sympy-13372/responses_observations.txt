INITIAL ISSUE:
################################################################################
You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.
<IMPORTANT>
* If user provides a path, you should NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. Instead, you should explore the file system to find the file before working on it.
* When configuring git credentials, use "openhands" as the user.name and "openhands@all-hands.dev" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
* The assistant MUST NOT include comments in the code unless they are necessary to describe non-obvious behavior.
</IMPORTANT>
You have access to the following functions:

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #1: execute_bash ----
Description: Execute a bash command in the terminal.
* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, it should be run in the background and the output should be redirected to a file, e.g. command = `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`.
* Interactive: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. The assistant must then send a second call to terminal with an empty `command` (which will retrieve any additional logs), or it can send additional text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process, or it can send command=`ctrl+c` to interrupt the process.
* Timeout: If a command execution result says "Command timed out. Sending SIGINT to the process", the assistant should retry running the command in the background.

Parameters:
  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `ctrl+c` to interrupt the currently running process.
---- END FUNCTION #1 ----

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: finish ----
Description: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.
No parameters are required for this function.
---- END FUNCTION #2 ----

---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----
Description: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files
* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user
* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep
* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file
* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`
* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`

Notes for using the `str_replace` command:
* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!
* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique
* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`

Parameters:
  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.
Allowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]
  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/workspace/file.py` or `/workspace`.
  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.
  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.
  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.
  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.
  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.
---- END FUNCTION #3 ----


If you choose to call a function ONLY reply in the following format with NO suffix:

<function=example_function_name>
<parameter=example_parameter_1>value_1</parameter>
<parameter=example_parameter_2>
This is the value for the second parameter
that can span
multiple lines
</parameter>
</function>

<IMPORTANT>
Reminder:
- Function calls MUST follow the specified format, start with <function= and end with </function>
- Required parameters MUST be specified
- Only call one function at a time
- You may provide optional reasoning for your function call in natural language BEFORE the function call, but NOT after.
- If there is no function call available, answer the question like normal with your current knowledge and do not tell the user about function calls


Here's a running example of how to perform a task with the provided tools.

--------------------- START OF EXAMPLE ---------------------

USER: Create a list of numbers from 1 to 10, and display them in a web page at port 5000.

ASSISTANT: Sure! Let me first check the current directory:
<function=execute_bash>
<parameter=command>
pwd && ls
</parameter>
</function>

USER: EXECUTION RESULT of [execute_bash]:
/workspace
openhands@runtime:~/workspace$

ASSISTANT: There is no `app.py` file in the current directory. Let me create a Python file `app.py`:
<function=str_replace_editor>
<parameter=command>create</parameter>
<parameter=path>/workspace/app.py</parameter>
<parameter=file_text>
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    numbers = list(range(1, 11))
    return str(numbers)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(port=5000)
</parameter>
</function>

USER: EXECUTION RESULT of [str_replace_editor]:
File created successfully at: /workspace/app.py

ASSISTANT: I have created a Python file `app.py` that will display a list of numbers from 1 to 10 when you run it. Let me run the Python file for you:
<function=execute_bash>
<parameter=command>
python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &
</parameter>
</function>

USER: EXECUTION RESULT of [execute_bash]:
[1] 121
[1]+  Exit 1                  python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1

ASSISTANT: Looks like the server is running with PID 121 then crashed. Let me check the server log:
<function=execute_bash>
<parameter=command>
cat server.log
</parameter>
</function>

USER: EXECUTION RESULT of [execute_bash]:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/workspace/app.py", line 2, in <module>
    from flask import Flask
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'flask'

ASSISTANT: Looks like the server crashed because the `flask` module is not installed. Let me install the `flask` module for you:
<function=execute_bash>

--------------------- END OF EXAMPLE ---------------------

Do NOT assume the environment is the same as in the example above.

--------------------- NEW TASK DESCRIPTION ---------------------
<uploaded_files>
/workspace/sympy__sympy__1.1
</uploaded_files>
I've uploaded a python code repository in the directory sympy__sympy__1.1. Consider the following PR description:

<pr_description>
UnboundLocalError in evalf
```
>>> Mul(x, Max(0, y), evaluate=False).evalf()
x*Max(0, y)
>>> Mul(Max(0, y), x, evaluate=False).evalf()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./sympy/core/evalf.py", line 1285, in evalf
    rf = evalf_table[x.func]
KeyError: Max

During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "./sympy/core/evalf.py", line 1394, in evalf
    result = evalf(self, prec + 4, options)
  File "./sympy/core/evalf.py", line 1286, in evalf
    r = rf(x, prec, options)
  File "./sympy/core/evalf.py", line 538, in evalf_mul
    arg = evalf(arg, prec, options)
  File "./sympy/core/evalf.py", line 1308, in evalf
    r = re, im, reprec, imprec
UnboundLocalError: local variable 'reprec' referenced before assignment
```

I found this after changing the order of Mul args in https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/13059.

Based on the code, I think the elif clauses that define reprec and imprec should have an `else: raise NotImplementedError`. That appears to fix it, although I didn't try to debug to see why the arg order is mattering here. 

</pr_description>

Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?
I've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!
Your task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /workspace directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.
Follow these steps to resolve the issue:
1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.
2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the BashTool, to confirm the error
3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue
4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!
5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well
Your thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.
--------------------- END OF NEW TASK DESCRIPTION ---------------------

PLEASE follow the format strictly! PLEASE EMIT ONE AND ONLY ONE FUNCTION CALL PER MESSAGE.

<extra_info>
The following information has been included based on a keyword match for "github". It may or may not be relevant to the user's request.

You have access to an environment variable, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, which allows you to interact with
the GitHub API.

You can use `curl` with the `GITHUB_TOKEN` to interact with GitHub's API.
ALWAYS use the GitHub API for operations instead of a web browser.

Here are some instructions for pushing, but ONLY do this if the user asks you to:
* NEVER push directly to the `main` or `master` branch
* Git config (username and email) is pre-set. Do not modify.
* You may already be on a branch called `openhands-workspace`. Create a new branch with a better name before pushing.
* Use the GitHub API to create a pull request, if you haven't already
* Use the main branch as the base branch, unless the user requests otherwise
* After opening or updating a pull request, send the user a short message with a link to the pull request.
* Do all of the above in as few steps as possible. E.g. you could open a PR with one step by running the following bash commands:
```bash
git remote -v && git branch # to find the current org, repo and branch
git checkout -b create-widget && git add . && git commit -m "Create widget" && git push -u origin create-widget
curl -X POST "https://api.github.com/repos/$ORG_NAME/$REPO_NAME/pulls" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
    -d '{"title":"Create widget","head":"create-widget","base":"openhands-workspace"}'
```
