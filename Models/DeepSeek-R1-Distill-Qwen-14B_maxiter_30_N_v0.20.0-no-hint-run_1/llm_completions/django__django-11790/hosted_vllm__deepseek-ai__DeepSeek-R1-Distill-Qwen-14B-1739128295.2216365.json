By setting `is_input` to `true`, the assistant can interact with the running process and send empty `command` to retrieve any additional logs, or send additional text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process, or send command like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process.\n* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty string to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the currently running process. Note: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n  (2) is_input (string, optional): If True, the command is an input to the running process. If False, the command is a bash command to be executed in the terminal.

Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFrom the issue description, it looks like a regression was introduced in commit 5ceaf14. The problem is that the username field in the AuthenticationForm isn't rendering with the maxlength attribute anymore. This is causing issues because the attribute is important for HTML validation and consistency.\n\nFirst, I should find where the AuthenticationForm is defined. In Django, forms are usually in the forms.py file. So I'll check the repository structure. The uploaded files include django__django__3.1, so I'll look inside that directory.\n\nI'll use the str_replace_editor function to view the contents of the forms.py file in the django/contrib/auth directory. This will help me locate the AuthenticationForm class.\n\nOnce I have the file, I'll look for the AuthenticationForm class. I suspect that the username field is defined there. The issue is that the maxlength attribute isn't being set when the form is rendered.\n\nIn Django forms, fields have a max_length parameter, which should be converted to the maxlength attribute in the HTML. If it's not showing up, maybe the form field isn't correctly passing this attribute.\n\nI'll check the definition of the username field. It should be something like UsernameField. I'll look for where the widget is defined or if there's any custom rendering that might be stripping the maxlength attribute.\n\nI remember that in Django, the form field's widget can be customized. Maybe the widget for the username field is not including the maxlength attribute. Alternatively, perhaps the form's rendering logic was changed in the regression, causing the attribute to be omitted.\n\nTo fix this, I need to ensure that the username field's widget includes the maxlength attribute. I can do this by setting the widget's maxlength attribute explicitly when defining the field.\n\nSo, I'll modify the username field in the AuthenticationForm to include widget=forms.TextInput(attrs={'maxlength': str(max_length)}). This should ensure that the attribute is passed to the HTML input.\n\nI'll create a patch using the str_replace_editor function to replace the relevant lines in forms.py. I'll make sure to only change the necessary parts to keep the fix minimal.\n\nAfter making the change, I'll run a test script to reproduce the issue and confirm that the maxlength attribute is now present. This script will render the form and check the output HTML.\n\nI should also consider any edge cases, like if the max_length is set to None or if the field is used in different contexts. But since the issue is specific to the username field, focusing on that should suffice.\n\nFinally, I'll execute the test script to ensure the problem is resolved. If the attribute appears, the fix is successful.\n</think>\n\n<|begin_of_thought|>\n\nLet me help fix the issue with the AuthenticationForm's username field maxlength attribute.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the repository structure.

Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFrom the issue description, it looks like a regression was introduced in commit 5ceaf14. The problem is that the username field in the AuthenticationForm isn't rendering with the maxlength attribute anymore. This is causing issues because the attribute is important for HTML validation and consistency.\n\nFirst, I should find where the AuthenticationForm is defined. In Django, forms are usually in the forms.py file. So I'll check the repository structure. The uploaded files include django__django__3.1, so I'll look inside that directory.\n\nI'll use the str_replace_editor function to view the contents of the forms.py file in the django/contrib/auth directory. This will help me locate the AuthenticationForm class.\n\nOnce I have the file, I'll look for the AuthenticationForm class. I suspect that the username field is defined there. The issue is that the maxlength attribute isn't being set when the form is rendered.\n\nIn Django forms, fields have a max_length parameter, which should be converted to the maxlength attribute in the HTML. If it's not showing up, maybe the form field isn't correctly passing this attribute.\n\nI'll check the definition of the username field. It should be something like UsernameField. I'll look for where the widget is defined or if there's any custom rendering that might be stripping the maxlength attribute.\n\nI remember that in Django, the form field's widget can be customized. Maybe the widget for the username field is not including the maxlength attribute. Alternatively, perhaps the form's rendering logic was changed in the regression, causing the attribute to be omitted.\n\nTo fix this, I need to ensure that the username field's widget includes the maxlength attribute. I can do this by setting the widget's maxlength attribute explicitly when defining the field.\n\nSo, I'll modify the username field in the AuthenticationForm to include widget=forms.TextInput(attrs={'maxlength': str(max_length)}). This should ensure that the attribute is passed to the HTML input.\n\nI'll create a patch using the str_replace_editor function to replace the relevant lines in forms.py. I'll make sure to only change the necessary parts to keep the fix minimal.\n\nAfter making the change, I'll run a test script to reproduce the issue and confirm that the maxlength attribute is now present. This script will render the form and check the output HTML.\n\nI should also consider any edge cases, like if the max_length is set to None or if the field is used in different contexts. But since the issue is specific to the username field, focusing on that should suffice.\n\nFinally, I'll execute the test script to ensure the problem is resolved. If the attribute appears, the fix is successful.\n</think>\n\n<|begin_of_thought|>\n\nLet me help fix the issue with the AuthenticationForm's username field maxlength attribute.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the repository structure.

Let me look at the provided code.\n\nThe problem is in the AuthenticationForm class. The username field uses the UsernameField, which is a subclass of forms.CharField. I see that UsernameField sets some widget attributes but not maxlength.\n\nIn the code, the username field is defined as:\nusername = UsernameField(widget=forms.TextInput(attrs={'autofocus': True}))\n\nI need to add the maxlength attribute here. The value should come from the user model's USERNAME_FIELD max_length, with a default of 254.\n\nLooking at the __init__ method of AuthenticationForm, it already sets the max_length based on the user model's field. So, I can reuse that value for the widget.\n\nI'll modify the username field to include the maxlength attribute in the widget. That should fix the issue.\n\nSo, the change is to update the widget's attrs to include 'maxlength' with the appropriate value.\n</think>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nI'll help fix the issue.
