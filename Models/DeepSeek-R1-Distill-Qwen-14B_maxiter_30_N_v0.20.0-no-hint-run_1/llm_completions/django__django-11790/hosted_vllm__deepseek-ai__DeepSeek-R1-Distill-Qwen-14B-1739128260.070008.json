Instead, you should explore the file system to find the file before working on it.\n* When configuring git credentials, use \"openhands\" as the user.name and \"openhands@all-hands.dev\" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* The assistant MUST NOT include comments in the code unless they are necessary to describe non-obvious behavior.\n</IMPORTANT>\nYou have access to the following functions:\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #1: execute_bash ----\nDescription: Execute a bash command in the terminal.\n* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, it should be run in the background and the output should be redirected to a file, e.g. command = `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`.\n* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, the assistant can interact with the running process and send empty `command` to retrieve any additional logs, or send additional text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process, or send command like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process.\n* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty string to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the currently running process. Note: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n  (2) is_input (string, optional): If True, the command is an input to the running process. If False, the command is a bash command to be executed in the terminal. Default is False.\nAllowed values: [`true`, `false`]\n---- END FUNCTION #1 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: finish ----\nDescription: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.\nNo parameters are required for this function.\n---- END FUNCTION #2 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----\nDescription: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files in plain-text format\n* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user\n* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n\nNotes for using the `str_replace` command:\n* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!\n* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique\n* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\nAllowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]\n  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/workspace/file.py` or `/workspace`.\n  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\n  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\n  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.\n  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.\n  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.\n---- END FUNCTION #3 ----\n\n\nIf you choose to call a function ONLY reply in the following format with NO suffix:\n\n<function=example_function_name>\n<parameter=example_parameter_1>value_1</parameter>\n<parameter=example_parameter_2>\nThis is the value for the second parameter\nthat can span\nmultiple lines\n</parameter>\n</function>\n\n<IMPORTANT>\nReminder:\n- Function calls MUST follow the specified format, start with <function= and end with </function>\n- Required parameters MUST be specified\n- Only call one function at a time\n- You may provide optional reasoning for your function call in natural language BEFORE the function call, but NOT after.\n- If there is no function call available, answer the question like normal with your current knowledge and do not tell the user about function calls\n</IMPORTANT>\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Here's a running example of how to perform a task with the provided tools.\n\n--------------------- START OF EXAMPLE ---------------------\n\nUSER: Create a list of numbers from 1 to 10, and display them in a web page at port 5000.\n\nASSISTANT: Sure!

Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFrom the issue description, it looks like a regression was introduced in commit 5ceaf14. The problem is that the username field in the AuthenticationForm isn't rendering with the maxlength attribute anymore. This is causing issues because the attribute is important for HTML validation and consistency.\n\nFirst, I should find where the AuthenticationForm is defined. In Django, forms are usually in the forms.py file. So I'll check the repository structure. The uploaded files include django__django__3.1, so I'll look inside that directory.\n\nI'll use the str_replace_editor function to view the contents of the forms.py file in the django/contrib/auth directory. This will help me locate the AuthenticationForm class.\n\nOnce I have the file, I'll look for the AuthenticationForm class. I suspect that the username field is defined there. The issue is that the maxlength attribute isn't being set when the form is rendered.\n\nIn Django forms, fields have a max_length parameter, which should be converted to the maxlength attribute in the HTML. If it's not showing up, maybe the form field isn't correctly passing this attribute.\n\nI'll check the definition of the username field. It should be something like UsernameField. I'll look for where the widget is defined or if there's any custom rendering that might be stripping the maxlength attribute.\n\nI remember that in Django, the form field's widget can be customized. Maybe the widget for the username field is not including the maxlength attribute. Alternatively, perhaps the form's rendering logic was changed in the regression, causing the attribute to be omitted.\n\nTo fix this, I need to ensure that the username field's widget includes the maxlength attribute. I can do this by setting the widget's maxlength attribute explicitly when defining the field.\n\nSo, I'll modify the username field in the AuthenticationForm to include widget=forms.TextInput(attrs={'maxlength': str(max_length)}). This should ensure that the attribute is passed to the HTML input.\n\nI'll create a patch using the str_replace_editor function to replace the relevant lines in forms.py. I'll make sure to only change the necessary parts to keep the fix minimal.\n\nAfter making the change, I'll run a test script to reproduce the issue and confirm that the maxlength attribute is now present. This script will render the form and check the output HTML.\n\nI should also consider any edge cases, like if the max_length is set to None or if the field is used in different contexts. But since the issue is specific to the username field, focusing on that should suffice.\n\nFinally, I'll execute the test script to ensure the problem is resolved.
