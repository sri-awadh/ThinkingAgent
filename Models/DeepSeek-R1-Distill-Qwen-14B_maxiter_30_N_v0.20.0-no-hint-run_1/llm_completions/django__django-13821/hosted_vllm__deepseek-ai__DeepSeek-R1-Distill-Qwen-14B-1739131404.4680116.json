By setting `is_input` to `true`, the assistant can interact with the running process and send empty `command` to retrieve any additional logs, or send additional text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process, or send command like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process.\n* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty string to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the currently running process. Note: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n  (2) is_input (string, optional): If True, the command is an input to the running process. If False, the command is a bash command to be executed in the terminal. Default is False.\nAllowed values: [`true`, `false`]\n---- END FUNCTION #1 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: finish ----\nDescription: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.\nNo parameters are required for this function.\n---- END FUNCTION #2 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----\nDescription: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files in plain-text format\n* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user\n* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n\nNotes for using the `str_replace` command:\n* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!\n* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique\n* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\nAllowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]\n  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/workspace/file.py` or `/workspace`.\n  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\n  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\n  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added).

Let me start by understanding the issue.\n\nFirst, the issue description mentions that Django currently supports SQLite versions where indexes on expressions and JSON1 support require at least 3.9.0. They also note that some older versions of SQLite are EOL, so it's time to drop support for versions below 3.9.0.\n\nThe user has already updated the test files, so I don't need to touch those. My task is to modify the non-test files in the repository.\n\nI'll begin by exploring the repository structure. The uploaded file is django__django__3.2, which I assume is the Django source code. I'll need to look into the Django codebase to find where SQLite version checks are made.\n\nIn Django, database backends are handled in the db subdirectory. The SQLite backend is in django/db/backends/sqlite3. I remember that there are version checks in the utils.py file, specifically the DatabaseVersion class which checks the SQLite version.\n\nI should find where the minimum version is set. Looking into sqlite3/utils.py, there's a class DatabaseVersion that uses a tuple for the version. The current minimum might be set to (3, 8, 7) as that's what Debian Jessie had. I need to change this to (3, 9, 0).\n\nNext, I'll need to edit the DatabaseVersion class to enforce this new minimum. This will involve modifying the _sqlite_version_info method to raise a ImproperlyConfigured error if the version is below 3.9.0.\n\nI should also check if there are any other places in the code that reference the SQLite version. For example, in the Django documentation or any release notes, but since the user is only asking to modify the source code, I'll focus on the code changes.\n\nNow, I'll create a script to test the changes. The script should import Django's DatabaseVersion and trigger the error when using an SQLite version below 3.9.0. I'll write a Python script that simulates an older SQLite version and runs the check.\n\nAfter making the code changes, I'll run the script using execute_bash to ensure the error is correctly raised. If the error appears, it means the check is working as intended.\n\nI should also consider edge cases, like when the SQLite version is exactly 3.9.0 or higher. The check should allow those versions without issues.\n\nFinally, I'll make sure that the changes are minimal and only affect the necessary parts of the code, keeping the rest intact to avoid introducing new bugs.\n</think>\n\n<|begin_of_thought|>\n\nLet me analyze how to implement the SQLite < 3.9.0 deprecation in the Django repository.\n\n1. First, I need to understand the Django repository structure. The uploaded files contain Django 3.2 source code.\n\n2. The key file to modify is `django/db/backends/sqlite3/utils.py` where the SQLite version checks are implemented.\n\n3. I need to update the `DatabaseVersion` class to enforce the minimum SQLite version of 3.9.0.\n\n4.

The change will involve modifying the version comparison in the `get_sqlite_version()` method.\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\nLet me make the necessary changes to enforce SQLite >= 3.9.0:", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"index": 1, "function": {"arguments": "{\"command\": \"str_replace\", \"path\": \"/workspace/django__django__3.2/django/db/backends/sqlite3/utils.py\", \"old_str\": \"def get_sqlite_version(connection):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    Return the SQLite version as a tuple (major, minor, micro).\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    # This method is only called once per connection, so it's safe to\\n    # use a cached value.\\n    if not hasattr(connection, '_sqlite_version_info'):\\n        # We need to get the version info directly from the database\\n        # as the sqlite3 module may not have the same version as the\\n        # one used by the server.\\n        cursor = connection.cursor()\\n        try:\\n            cursor.execute('SELECT sqlite_version()')\\n            version = cursor.fetchone()[0]\\n        finally:\\n            cursor.close()\\n        # Convert from string like '3.8.7' to tuple (3, 8, 7)\\n        parts = list(map(int, version.split('.')))\\n        connection._sqlite_version_info = tuple(parts)\\n    return connection._sqlite_version_info\", \"new_str\": \"def get_sqlite_version(connection):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    Return the SQLite version as a tuple (major, minor, micro).\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    # This method is only called once per connection, so it's safe to\\n    # use a cached value.\\n    if not hasattr(connection, '_sqlite_version_info'):\\n        # We need to get the version info directly from the database\\n        # as the sqlite3 module may not have the same version as the\\n        # one used by the server.\\n        cursor = connection.cursor()\\n        try:\\n            cursor.execute('SELECT sqlite_version()')\\n            version = cursor.fetchone()[0]\\n        finally:\\n            cursor.close()\\n        # Convert from string like '3.8.7' to tuple (3, 8, 7)\\n        parts = list(map(int, version.split('.')))\\n        connection._sqlite_version_info = tuple(parts)\\n    version_info = get_sqlite_version(connection)\\n    if version_info < (3, 9, 0):\\n        raise ImproperlyConfigured(\\n            \\\"Django requires SQLite 3.9.0 or newer.
