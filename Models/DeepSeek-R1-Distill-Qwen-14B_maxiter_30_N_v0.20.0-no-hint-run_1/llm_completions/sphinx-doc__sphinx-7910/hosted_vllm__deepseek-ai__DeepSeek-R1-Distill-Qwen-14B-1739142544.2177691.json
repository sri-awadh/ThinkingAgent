By setting `is_input` to `true`, the assistant can interact with the running process and send empty `command` to retrieve any additional logs, or send additional text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process, or send command like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process.\n* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty string to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the currently running process. Note: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n  (2) is_input (string, optional): If True, the command is an input to the running process. If False, the command is a bash command to be executed in the terminal.

If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n\nNotes for using the `str_replace` command:\n* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!\n* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique\n* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\nAllowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]\n  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/workspace/file.py` or `/workspace`.\n  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\n  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\n  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.\n  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.\n  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start.

Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe user mentioned that they have `napoleon_include_init_with_doc` set to True, which should include __init__ in the docs. However, when __init__ is decorated with `functools.wraps`, it doesn't appear. The issue stems from a specific commit in Sphinx where the way the class owner is determined changed. Now, when the method is decorated, the `__globals__` attribute doesn't contain the class, causing Sphinx to think it's not a method.\n\nFirst, I should look into the relevant part of the Sphinx code. The problem is in the `get_class_members` function, specifically where it checks if the object is a method of the class. The current code retrieves the class from the object's `__globals__`, which doesn't work for decorated methods.\n\nI need to modify this part. Instead of relying on `__globals__`, I can check if the object is an instance of the class. If the class's `__dict__` contains the object, then it's a method. This approach should work whether or not the method is decorated.\n\nSo, I'll edit the `sphinx/napoleon/__init__.py` file. I'll replace the problematic lines with a check that looks for the object in the class's `__dict__`. This should correctly identify the method even when it's decorated.\n\nAfter making the change, I should test it. I'll create a script that imports the necessary modules and defines a class with a decorated __init__ method. Then, I'll run the script to see if the documentation now includes the __init__ method.\n\nI'll also consider edge cases, like other decorated methods or functions, to ensure the fix doesn't break anything else. Testing with different scenarios will help confirm that the solution is robust.\n\nFinally, I'll execute the test script using the execute_bash function to confirm that the issue is resolved.
