The problem is that the qop-options aren't being quoted correctly, which is causing issues with some servers. Let me think through how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should understand the current implementation. The user mentioned that the code isn't adding quotes around the qop-options. So, I need to find where in the code the Digest Auth headers are being constructed.\n\nI remember that in the requests library, authentication is handled in the auth.py file. Specifically, the DigestAuth class is where the headers are built. The digest_headers method is probably where the qop-options are set.\n\nLooking at the code, I see that the qop parameter is being passed, but it's not being quoted. So, I need to modify the code to ensure that if qop is provided, it's enclosed in double quotes.\n\nI should check if the qop parameter is being used correctly. If it's present, wrap it in quotes. For example, if qop is 'auth', it should become '\"auth\"'.\n\nI also need to make sure that this change doesn't break existing functionality. So, I'll test the change by running a script that reproduces the issue. If the script works after the change, it means the quotes are now correctly added.\n\nI'll create a test script that uses Digest Auth and checks the headers. If the qop is present, it should be quoted. Running this script with the modified code should show the correct quoting.\n\nAfter making the change, I'll rerun the test script to confirm the fix. If everything looks good, the issue should be resolved.\n\nI also need to consider edge cases, like when qop is not provided or is an empty string. The code should handle these gracefully without adding unnecessary quotes or causing errors.\n\nFinally, I'll update the relevant file, probably auth.py, and ensure that the change is minimal and doesn't affect other parts of the library.\n</think>\n\n<|begin_of_thought|>\n\nLet me help you fix the Digest Auth qop-options quoting issue in the requests repository.\n\n1.

The user has provided a detailed problem description and some initial steps they've taken. They're working on a Python repository for the `requests` library, specifically version 2.0.1, and they've encountered an issue with Digest Authentication where the `qop-options` aren't being quoted correctly.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the repository. The code is located in `/workspace/psf__requests__2.0`. I'll start by exploring this directory to familiarize myself with where the relevant files are. Since the user mentioned that the issue is with Digest Auth, I'll focus on the `auth.py` file, which likely contains the `DigestAuth` class.\n\nNext, the user tried to run a Python script to reproduce the error but encountered an `ImportError`. This suggests that either the `DigestAuth` class isn't present or isn't being exported correctly. To diagnose this, I'll execute a simple command to check the version of `requests` installed. The result shows version 2.0.1, confirming that the correct version is being used.\n\nNow, I'll look into the `auth.py` file to see how `DigestAuth` is implemented. I'll use the `str_replace_editor` function to view the contents of `auth.py`. Upon reviewing the code, I notice that the `DigestAuth` class is indeed present but might not be exporting all necessary attributes or methods.\n\nThe main issue is that the `qop-options` in the Digest headers aren't being quoted. According to RFC2617, these should be enclosed in double quotes. I'll need to modify the `digest_headers` method within the `DigestAuth` class to ensure that when `qop` is set, it's properly quoted.\n\nI'll create a test script to reproduce the issue. This script will instantiate `DigestAuth`, generate the digest headers, and print them out. Running this script will help confirm whether the `qop` parameter is correctly quoted.\n\nAfter making the necessary changes to the `digest_headers` method, I'll rerun the test script to verify that the issue has been resolved. Additionally, I'll consider edge cases, such as when `qop` is not set or when multiple `qop` values are present, to ensure the fix handles all scenarios correctly.\n\nFinally, I'll ensure that the changes are minimal and only affect the necessary parts of the code, adhering to the user's instructions to modify only non-test files and not alter the testing logic.\n</think>\n\n<|begin_of_thought|>\n\nLet me help you fix the Digest Auth qop-options quoting issue in the requests repository.\n\n1.

The problem is that the qop-options aren't being quoted correctly, which is causing issues with some servers. Let me think through how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should understand the current implementation. The user mentioned that the code isn't adding quotes around the qop-options. So, I need to find where in the code the Digest Auth headers are being constructed.\n\nI remember that in the requests library, authentication is handled in the auth.py file. Specifically, the DigestAuth class is where the headers are built. The digest_headers method is probably where the qop-options are set.\n\nLooking at the code, I see that the qop parameter is being passed, but it's not being quoted. So, I need to modify the code to ensure that if qop is provided, it's enclosed in double quotes.\n\nI should check if the qop parameter is being used correctly. If it's present, wrap it in quotes. For example, if qop is 'auth', it should become '\"auth\"'.\n\nI also need to make sure that this change doesn't break existing functionality. So, I'll test the change by running a script that reproduces the issue. If the script works after the change, it means the quotes are now correctly added.\n\nI'll create a test script that uses Digest Auth and checks the headers. If the qop is present, it should be quoted. Running this script with the modified code should show the correct quoting.\n\nAfter making the change, I'll rerun the test script to confirm the fix. If everything looks good, the issue should be resolved.\n\nI also need to consider edge cases, like when qop is not provided or is an empty string. The code should handle these gracefully without adding unnecessary quotes or causing errors.\n\nFinally, I'll update the relevant file, probably auth.py, and ensure that the change is minimal and doesn't affect other parts of the library.\n</think>\n\n<|begin_of_thought|>\n\nLet me help you fix the Digest Auth qop-options quoting issue in the requests repository.\n\n1.

The user has provided a detailed problem description and some initial steps they've taken. They're working on a Python repository for the `requests` library, specifically version 2.0.1, and they've encountered an issue with Digest Authentication where the `qop-options` aren't being quoted correctly.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the repository. The code is located in `/workspace/psf__requests__2.0`. I'll start by exploring this directory to familiarize myself with where the relevant files are. Since the user mentioned that the issue is with Digest Auth, I'll focus on the `auth.py` file, which likely contains the `DigestAuth` class.\n\nNext, the user tried to run a Python script to reproduce the error but encountered an `ImportError`. This suggests that either the `DigestAuth` class isn't present or isn't being exported correctly. To diagnose this, I'll execute a simple command to check the version of `requests` installed. The result shows version 2.0.1, confirming that the correct version is being used.\n\nNow, I'll look into the `auth.py` file to see how `DigestAuth` is implemented. I'll use the `str_replace_editor` function to view the contents of `auth.py`. Upon reviewing the code, I notice that the `DigestAuth` class is indeed present but might not be exporting all necessary attributes or methods.\n\nThe main issue is that the `qop-options` in the Digest headers aren't being quoted. According to RFC2617, these should be enclosed in double quotes. I'll need to modify the `digest_headers` method within the `DigestAuth` class to ensure that when `qop` is set, it's properly quoted.\n\nI'll create a test script to reproduce the issue. This script will instantiate `DigestAuth`, generate the digest headers, and print them out. Running this script will help confirm whether the `qop` parameter is correctly quoted.\n\nAfter making the necessary changes to the `digest_headers` method, I'll rerun the test script to verify that the issue has been resolved. Additionally, I'll consider edge cases, such as when `qop` is not set or when multiple `qop` values are present, to ensure the fix handles all scenarios correctly.\n\nFinally, I'll ensure that the changes are minimal and only affect the necessary parts of the code, adhering to the user's instructions to modify only non-test files and not alter the testing logic.\n</think>\n\n<|begin_of_thought|>\n\nLet me help you fix the Digest Auth qop-options quoting issue in the requests repository.\n\n1.
